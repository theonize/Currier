  "I do not know what I may appear to the world, 
but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, 
and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, 
whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."  
  
  "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."

## What is it?

  There are many patterns in Scripture.
If these patterns are divinely inspired then they will approachable and digestable inasmuch as God wants them to be.
This method involves four ways of gleaning this information:
* Historical
* Literary
* Lexical
* Theological
These approaches can be applied to the book as a whole, to passages, or to topics.
More on this method in [How to Study Your Bible](/Studies/How%20to%20Study%20Your%20Bible/index.md)
  
  There are various notes and studies that attempt to do this- 
hopefully the format is easily digestable and will motivate people to pursue God.
Apologies for the earlier stuff that is a journaled and scattered.


I believe in a personal God, the God of the Bible. 
I believe that He speaks through His Word to us and the most salient points are revealed to us by His Spirit. 
I believe that it is okay if there are things about Him that we don't fully understand but the essential things are knowable by all. 
I believe that He is holy, good, and just: but also, thankfully, merciful and gracious; but we cannot fully know any of these things. 
I believe that we cannot stand in His presence in our natural state and that is a purposeful dilemma designed to draw us to ask, "Why?"
