# Matthew 25:31-40

It is counterintuitive that caring for the infirm and invalid is a boon.
One might make a case for caring for the elderly because it teaches the next generation to care for us when we age;
 also, it helps to preserve wisdom.
But it is more difficult to make a case for preserving and upholding those who have never, and will never, reciprocate in any way.
The root of this mental discombobulation is a material world-view.

For most Christian believers it is enough to do as the Master commands: and once they begin harvesting fruit they begin acquiring a taste for the non-selfish greatness of it.
For those with a more cognitive bent the leap of faith is more difficult. 
Often our basis is in the limited, in scarcity.
We forget, or perhaps never knew, that God is unrestrained. 
We think we must get our piece of the pie before it's all taken. 
God will simply make another pie.
