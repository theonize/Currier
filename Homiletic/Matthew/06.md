# Matthew 6

## Brief

Story about the brit, "in England we don't own guns and we have _almost_ no gun violence."
That connecting word "almost" is very important- if They gave up liberty to "almost" live in peace and security.
Jesus was a master of these connecting words, as was Paul.
In fact Queen Victoria said she was saved by a "but".
1 Cor 1:26-27 ~ not many noble are called... **but** God used the foolish to confound the wise.

Matthew 6 has a very important connector: "therefore" (v. 25);
"Therefore" do not worry about what you will eat or drink or wear.
"Therefore" God knows what you need and wants to provide it for you.
"Therefore" let tomorrow worry about itself.
But what is the "therefore" connecting to for us?

The chapter begins with religious practices: charity, prayer, fasting, and investment.
Jesus is assuming that his disciples will be doing these things.
The issue he presents to us is the effectiveness and efficiency of these practices.
Effectiveness is doing the right things; efficiency is doing things right.
The hyprocrite appears to do the right things, but do them the wrong way.
The hypocrite is innefficient for the Kingdom of God.
But they are also ineffective because, for them, the religious act and the honor they get from it it the end.
For the disciple of Christ, the religious act is a means to an end: proximity to God...closeness to God.
Look at the repeated phrase "Do ### in secret and God will reward you."

Private religious, spiritual practices bring us closer to God.
**Therefore** when our effort is subsumed into God's work, His will, we will have what we need provided.

v.33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well.

Jesus is laying the foundation for the notion of true piety:
- James says "Pure...religion...is this: to look after orphans and widows...and to keep oneself unstained from the world." (CSB, ann.)
- These religious acts are not the end goal, they are a means to an end

Fear is not, in fact cannot be, forbidden. 
What is admonished is worry- that is, letting fear settle in and drive us.
