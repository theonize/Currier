* what comes before:

      * Charity
      * prayer
      * fasting
      * investment
      * ingestion
    * Why not?
      * Forego reward from God
      * Considerations
        * Efficiency ~ doing things right
        * Effectiveness ~ doing the right things

Jesus is laying the foundation for the notion of true piety:
- James says "Pure...religion...is this: to look after orphans and widows...and to keep oneself unstained from the world." (CSB, ann.)
- These religious acts are not the end goal, they are a means to an end

Fear is not, in fact cannot be, forbidden. 
What is admonished is worry- that is, letting fear settle in and drive us.
