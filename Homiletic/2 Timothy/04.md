2 Timothy 4:13

"When you come, be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books, and especially my papers."

History
  Written from the Roman Mamertine dungeon around 65AD.
  His prior imprisonment was a house-arrest but this was death row.
  Paul had already had a preliminary trial (v16) and expected execution (v6) as an enemy of the state.
  Timothy was in Ephesus and was prompted to come before/during Fall (v21).
  His lack of a cloak signals that his arrest was sudden.
  It probably is an actual garment but could also have been a book "case".
  The documents in question were probably scriptures, his own writings and legal documents (e.g. citizenship documents.)
  ..."especially" likely indicated the ones he wanted to finish or curate.


Culture
  Paul cares about body (cloak), mind (scrolls/books) and mission (papers).
  Paul is still engaged in mission by trying to complete work and send or workers (v10b-12).
  ...even on death row the work continues.
