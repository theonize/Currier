Transmission


The Pattern
	Discipleship
		= training the next generation
		~ the addict into rehab; intensive, then slowly given freedom to fly
=======
Providential Examples
	Dead sea scrolls ~ 100BC - 100AD
	Masoretic text ~ 1000AD

	Diocletian
		"the christian is destroyed and the worship of the gods restored"
		10 years later ~ Christendom
	Voltaire
		"50 years from now: the world will hear no more about the Bible"
		50 years later the Geneva Bible Society began printing Bibles on his printing press
	Tyndale ~ executed for publishing an english Bible
	Thomas Payne
		"when I get through there will not be 5 Bibles in America"

Why?
	Titus 1 - He rescued us from lawlessness
	1Tim 1:9 - the law is for the lawless
	He gave us the law, and did it progressively, to author up as many saved as possible


Written Language
	perspicuity
		= able to look through, transparency, clearness
		"the Bible is a plain book", see "Golden Principle" later
		Psalm 119:130
		clarity in things which are meant to be known
		timeless terms and figures of speech
	endurance
		John 10:35 - permanent truths
		2 Peter 1:19 - satisfies the diligent
		Acts 8:26+ - effectually calls the searcher
		not our responsibility directly
			1Tim 2:3-4

Progressive revelation?
	dates of transmission
		revelation - not amendment
			the λογος was already, the γραφει is created
		backwards compatibility is hard when it's perfectly intricate and expansive
	types of transmission

The Human Element
	tent-maker ~ skenopoios (scenographer)
		Acts 18:3 (Php 4:3)
		idiom or tradecraft
		Pharisee <> skins
	Scripture is indestructible
		1Pet 1:23-25
		a warning to meddlers: Rev 22:19
	fiduciary
		= a trustee
		men are entrusted to do the work of tranmitting the Word, but the responsibility [and logistics] are God's pervue
		1Thess 2:8
			we are His testimony
			implies a beneficiary
		Matt 25
			accountability not of γραφει but of ourselves [transformed by the Word]
			we cannot diminish the gift
			5 = grace
			2 = partnership
			1 = unity, theosis, godliness (we blew it)
			God takes the responsibility for preserving γραφει
