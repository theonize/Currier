...the idea that God does work; usually applied to the salvation "act"

The problem with the above definition is our temporal view of salvation.
Salvation is not a point-specific, momentary act.
It is actually the re-creation of an entier life at once.


This is an issue that can proof-texted in oblivion while we try to form-fit it to our presuppositions and desires.
It is, therefore, highly important to remember these Biblical themes:
- human depravity
- necessary divine propitiation


[Eph 1:4-5]
He chose us
He predestined us


[Rom 9:16]
it = election, the adoption that we term _salvation_
...does not depend on human will or exertion


[Rom 8:28-30]
"called according to His purpose" ~ this is all people who do the will of God, not neceesarily believers

"whom He foreknew He also predestined"
This is a topological statement rather than a commentary on free-will.
God sees a human life as a whole - it begins apart from Him and, hopefully, has a rewritten ending that is brought back to Him.

predestination -> calling -> justification -> theosis
There may well be a call to all men [Rom 1] but this sentence focuses on those who will heed the call.

Also, the point of the greater passage is God's care for His people in light of His greater plan for the flow of history.


[John 3:36]
"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life"
Eternal life, which we suppose is salvation, is solely contingent on **belief**.


[Rom 10:4-14]
"everyone who" believes/calls

The people who are believing are the ones who are calling in this passage.
The belief is clearly derived from hearing the Word from preachers - both of which are given by God.
