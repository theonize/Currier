Lapsarianism
 = the proposition that there is an order to God's decrees


Supra/Ante - election preceded reprobation

this is ridiculous because God is antetemporal
  these are mutually predictive and exhortive
  i.e. why can't we be redeemed and sanctified at once?  why must salvation be instantaneous?
