Solum Nomen
The main position of name theology is: all that is required is the invocation of God's name to have righteousness, faithful works, etc.

There are two main issues with this position:
1. There is no concrete basis for belief as there is with Biblical faith.
2. It stands to reason that a successful incarnation of such power would eventually be modified and disseminated.

In reality the outcomes of spiritual faith varied and disparate:
1. God is not beholden to our whims, named or not.
2. God's plans are beyond our understanding.
