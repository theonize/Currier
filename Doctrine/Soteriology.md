Soteriology


## The Need for Salvation
saved from what?
  [Rom 5:9] God's wrath
  [Jms 1:15] ~ death


## Belief
...belief is, consequently, tied to loyalty ~ "Jesus is LORD"
Naaman ~ [2Kgs 5:15]
Widow of Zarepheth [1Kgs 17:24]
~ were they "saved"?


## Work

Do we have any part in our salvation?
- if we don't then there is no point in the Great Commission; we ought just wait for end while God works.

What is our part in salvation?
- Jesus said "he who looks on me and believes has eternal life" [Jn 6:40]
- Our part is minimal but does exist.  God makes the path and creates the framework in which we _might_ believe- but we must _look_.
But what does _look_ mean?
Matthew 7:21 ~ "not everyone who says 'Lord, Lord' will enter the kingdom of heaven."
- What is the difference between _looking_ and _saying Lord_?
<TODO>
James 4:10 ~ "humble yourselves before the Lord and He will lift you up"
- if/then 

John 5:40 ~ "you refuse to come to me to have life"
- this capability to refuse implies a capability to accept; i.e. we make a fruitful choice, not an empty one.


## Enabling

God enables people to believe.
There is nothing [in scripture] preventing God from disabling people's opportunity to choose/believe.


## Ties to Christology

The predeterministic view necessarily divorces the Father and Son's part in salvation:
- The Father predetermines who will be saved
- Then, the Son does His work in the believers
- This implies, in part, that Christ and the Father have a separate nature and purpose when it comes to salvation...?

Further, if certain humans are predestined for heaven, and other for hell, then wy are humans judged for sin?
How can there be guilt in sin if it is predestined?


## Problem Texts

There are many texts that are problematic for predestination and free-will positions.
Much of the problems come from traditional, or novel, English translations- the same word original word translated differently in different places.
Resolution of sticking points necessitates precision and erudition but, later, consolidation and simplification.
Simplifying does not mean distillation but, rather, 


### Confession
[1Jon 4:2-3] ~ Christ is at the core


The Tenses of Salvation
	past, present, future

	[1Cor 13:13] these three: faith, hope, love
		faith ~ based on His past work
		hope ~ looking forward
		love ~ looking up

	[Php 1:6]
		He who began - justification
		a good work in you - sanctification
		will carry it on to completion - glorification


Sin, from which we are saved
	penalty ~ death, tetellastai (paid in full)
	power ~ bondage, 
	presence ~

## Disbelief

[Num 14] How long will this people despise me...and not believe


## Once for Always

There is a tension in salvation where we, in our pride, insist that we must contribute to it.
However, if we could contribute to our salvation then it wouldn't be perfect [we are not perfect].
But [Heb 4:3] tells us that belief is a requirement for salvation.
We must allow this tension to stand: a requirement is not necessarily a contributing action (a.k.a. _work_).
We are not saved by any action of ours [Eph 2:8-9] - not a ritual, not a prayer, not a flick of the wrist.
What cannot be gained by moral perfection cannot be lost by moral imperfection.

The Lutherans use the language that God _brings_ us faith, righteousness, justification.


## Tenses of Salvation

We were saved by faith, which He gave us.
We are saved by righteousness, which He gives us.
We will be saved by justification, which He gives us.

Age of Accountability
---

[2Sam 12:22-23]
	David was heavenbound, thus the child went there

[Rom 7:9]
	There is a time of life when we are _not_ guilty

[Rom 8:12-14]
	Death is because of sin
	But trangression, and guilt, is what separates from God


## Misnomers
- Salvation is not dependent on being able to articulate theology
	- i.e. not all theologians are "saved"
- Salvation is not a feeling
- Salvation is not dependent on anything that we do
- Bad theology does, necessarily, preclude salvation
	- Arians denied eternality of Christ but were considered "brethren" by Nicaean attendees
