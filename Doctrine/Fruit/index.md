This list derives from [Gal 5:22-23].
There are two important considerations:
- Nowhere, and at no time, have these qualities been outlawed [Gal 5:23]
- The term is _singular_: 'fruit'.  These are not qualities that we can improve as in a skill; rather, these are evidences of an indwelling Spirit.  Further, they are attained by relationship with Yahweh - not through study or practice (which are also derivative).


"God does not make lop-sided Christians."
- [D. L. Moody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_L._Moody)
- Galatians 5:22-23 says "fruit" in the singular.  These are not like gifts where may have one or the other- all are evident in the true believer.

"Fruit does not save, but salvation is fruitful."
- [John MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacArthur)


Fruit is produced in us, not by us.
