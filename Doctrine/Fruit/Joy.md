# Joy
~ Unremitting delight.

Not to be confused with happiness, which is temporary, the Biblical idea is unshakeable, hopeful, courageous cheer.

Moral joy is the quality of people who their values in deep harmony with their behavior.
...a by-product of successful moral struggle.

This is not contrary to, but disparate from Christian joy because our morality need not be aligned with God's.

Christian joy is founded in an inner remodeling by God whereby we are simply aligned with God and the morality is a thereof.
