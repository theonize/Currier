# Authorship

A clear picture of biblical authorship is the tabernacle furniture: it was shown to Moses who described it and then replicated it.

It could be said, with vast historical support, that Biblical texts were written by the traditional authors and edited/compiled by others.

Some texts that indicate this are:
- [Gen 14:4] 
  - "Dan" in [Gen 14:4] ~ the city of Lachish is referred to as Dan but it was not so-named until the tribe settled there after Joshua's conquest.
  - use of an ancestral name which was not given until after Moses' death [Jdg 18:29]
- [Deut 3:8] ~ dead sea Scrolls say "children of Israel"
- [Ez 1] ~ mix of 1st and 3rd person
- [Ps 72] ~ "the Psalms of David are ended", probably means that [at one point] the book ended there
  - ...there is also a great deal of parallelism in the Psalms which supports the 5-books of psalms
  - i.e. Psalms was a sacred hymnal that was continually expanding

- [Deut 3:14] "unto this day"
  - what day?  makes no sense in Moses' day.
  - It does make sense in an exilic time-period.


The point is that scripture was written _and edited_ under inspiration.
- much of the editing occurred during the exile
- __under inspiration__ is an important phrase: verbal plenary inspiration means there were many, simultaneous contributors but that Yahweh influenced the writing thru orchestration, imputation, and coercion
