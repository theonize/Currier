# Authorship

Who wrote the book of ___?

Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ and yet I live, not I but Christ who lives in me."
- Christ did the work but we are commanded to work

There is some of God and some of man in every work of God.
The glory is God's but the responsibility from revelation is ours.


A clear picture of biblical authorship is the tabernacle furniture: it was shown to Moses who described it and then replicated it.

It could be said, with vast historical support, that Biblical texts were written by the traditional authors and edited/compiled by others.

Some texts that indicate this are:
- [Gen 14:14] 
  - "Dan" in [Gen 14:14] ~ the city of Laish is referred to as Dan but it was not so-named until the tribe settled there after Joshua's conquest.
  - use of an ancestral name which was not given until after Moses' death [Jdg 18:29]
<!-- - [Deut 3:18] ~ dead sea Scrolls say "children of Israel" -->
- [Ez 1] ~ mix of 1st and 3rd person
- [Ps 72] ~ "the Psalms of David are ended", probably means that [at one point] the book ended there
  - ...there is also a great deal of parallelism in the Psalms which supports the 5-books of psalms
  - i.e. Psalms was a sacred hymnal that was continually expanding
- [Prov 25] ~ proverbs recovered later (by Joash) and added to an existing book of Proverbs

- [Deut 3:14] "unto this day"
  - what day?
  - in Moses' day this land was conquered about 2 decades prior
  - it could make sense in an exilic time-period.


The point is that scripture was written _and edited_ under inspiration.
- much of the editing occurred during the Babylonian exile
- __under inspiration__ is an important phrase: verbal plenary inspiration means there were many, simultaneous contributors but that Yahweh influenced the writing thru orchestration, imputation, and coercion
