# Inspiration


Any evangelical theory of inspiration must honor the two-sided nature of inspiration.
Inspiration is first providential, then natural.

Inspired writing is a phenomenon but is not _paranormal_.
It is a culmination of a human life walked alongside Yahweh;
in conjunction with the inspired lives of others who interacted with them;
in conjunction with the inspired events of history surrounding them.

There are two main elements to inspiration:
1. God + human creativity
2. Purpose

The purpose of God is actually the same as ours- its just that He operates on an infinite level:
to know Him and make Him known.

As sacred stories were passed down, they were held in high regard, memorized, and presented verbatim.
Then written languages were employed and developed to record these with more permanence.
Then scholars collated and codified these writings into volumes that were held as of greater importance.
New languages and new methods of record were employed to spread this knowledge of the sacred.


[Jer 25:13]

## Downloading...
Very little of Scripture is directly downloaded in a man's head.
Additionally, very little of it is dictated.
Yahweh uses life circumstances, natural phenomena, and language (spoken and written).
Many of the subtle variances in Scripture make no sense if downloaded directly from an omniscient mind.

It is the human element that gives scripture it's genre and flavor.
It is the divine element that gives scripture it's consistency and veracity.

Examples:
- Passover [Ex 12] vs. [Deut 16]
- Each gospel records a different superscription on the cross
- Slave enjoinment [Ex 21:1-6] vs. [Deut 15:12-18]


## Plenary

Scripture is a joint effort of God and man.
Yahweh dwells in the believer [1Cor 3:16] who writes through and on divinely adjoined (subordinate) things [Col 1:17].
