Canonicity

Definition
~ Romans Catholics = the canon is an authoritative list of books
~ Protestants = the canon is a list of authoritative books

The issue is that an authoritative list must be presented by an authority.
These are the books that could not be kept out of the canon.
In a sense the Church discovered which books were canonical.


Criteria
	What criteria was used by the Church fathers to establish a book among the canon?
	- Apostolicity ~ was written by an Apostle or an associate of an Apostle?
	- Orthodoxy ~ does it conform to orthodox doctrine?
	- Catholicity ~ was it accepted by all the Church?
	
	If a book was found to have misattributed authorship it was always rejected.

	Christology ~ the treatment of the person of Christ is commonly misaffected in non-canonical literature.

	Gospel of Thomas [114]. Simon Peter says to them: "Let Mary go out from our midst, for women are not worthy of life!" Jesus says: "See, I will draw her so as to make her male so that she also may become a living spirit like you males. For every woman who has become male will enter the Kingdom of heaven."
	...does that belong in our New Testament?


Historical
	We must trust that providence has shaped events to install certain books in the canon;
	God determined the canon ~ not our responsibility
	OT canon finalized by B.C. 250
	NT canon finalization

Direct
	Gen 1:1
	Col 1:16
	Prov 8:22
	God foreknew the Scripture
	...because He is the Word
	...and He knows it's effect
	{transmission} (separately later)
Circular
	1 Timothy 5:18
		1st ref = Deut 25:4
		2nd ref = Luke 10:7
		...both referred to as Scripture
	2 Timothy 3:16
		θεοπνευστος = God-breathed
	2 Peter 1:16-21
		16) penned by eyewitnesses (both NT & OT)
			Daniel 4
		17-18) apostles eyewitnessed the canonization inauguration
		19) NT confirms OT
		20) Scriptures' origin
		21) prophecy ~ men carried by God
	2 Peter 3
		15) emphasis on Paul's γραφει as Scriptural
		16) equates Paul's γραφει with "other Scriptures"
	Circulation of Scriptures
		Col 4:16
		1 Thess 5:27

{Septuagint}
	several hundred quotations made in NT
	does this canonize it? or only those quotations?

[2Mac 2:13-15] reference to various writings

## Number of Books

### In Jesus Day
	Torah was canon
	doubt of some other books
	~ e.g. Sadducees held the Torah as superior to other books of the Tanakh (thus the reason Jesus taught them from the Torah)
	Jesus recognized the three-fold division of Scripture
	- law
	- writings
	- prophets
	Jews had 22 or 24 books back then
	Septuagint had 46 books
	Qumran
	...sect canonized [1Enoch] ~ they're considered outliers
	...all three major textual traditions were represented in the find

### Today
	Modern Tanakh has 34 books
	Anglicized tanakh has 39 books
	- the difference is Samuel-Kings is divided into 4 pieces nowadays
	- Ezra-Nehemiah was combined

## Selection Process
Both the Jews and Church fathers took consensus as divine inspiration
- e.g. Origen, Book of 1Enoch
	- Origen defending the canonicity of 1Enoch, but gave up the banner when he was the only one left holding it


### old testament
Early Church fathers selected the books that they knew to exist in Hebrew


## Verification

IF the plenary authorship includes an omniscient being the we would expect the contents to be entirely coherent.
- we see a common thread of redemption throughout the "standard" Bible; i.e. 66 books
- we see the _five solae_ in common amongst the books
- we chiasmic and inclusio structures throughout the Bible- not only within books, but across books
	- e.g. Revelation closes what Genesis opens, etc.
  - these literary structures may even demand a certain ordering which illuminates a particular doctrine
		- however, who's to say that multiple orderings are not valid?  maybe one per sola...and then covenantal...and the dispensational...and then historical...
