# Immutability
...immutability is the doctrine that God does not change.

Proponents argue that if God could change then our salvation is unsure.
Opponents argue that love & interaction require change.
I submit that both are wrong.


## Black & White Mary

Mary is a young person who was born into, and has only lived in, a black & white room.
She is exceedingly intelligent.
She has access to all knowledge and technology- though, all is uncolored.
Thus, she knows everything there is to know about light and how the brain processes visual information.
She also knows all about secondary topics like the psychology of color and the history and concepts of art.
One day, when she is grown-up and knows everything, she is allowed to leave the room and sees green grass, blue skies, and fall leaves for the first time.
Has she learned anything new?

If she has then she didn't know everything even though she had access to all recorded knowledge.
Clearly the was something in the experience of color that goes beyond physical knowledge.
She knew everything and yet changed.

If she hasn't then what is different about the outside world?
If there is no new thing in the colored world then the concepts we use to define the room vs the outside world are internally inconsistent.
This is clearly not an option...intellectually...et sic est.


## Unwritten Maths

Another examploe:
Imagine all of mathematics exists in some hyperdimensional textbook- every single concept, proof, and theorem.
Now imagine that little Johnny learns an equation for the first time and writes it down.
Has he created new maths?

If he has then there must be something more than just what's in the textbook.
The _instantiation_ (writing down, or speaking, or thinking) of maths is a new thing...a change.

If he has not created something new then the textbook is not only the ideals of mathematics but also every possible instantiation of it.
This would presume there is not, nor ever will be, anything new.
Further, there can be no creativity nor discovery nor innovation nor free will- all is already written.


## Platonic View

Seemingly, the predominant view of immutability in the Christian faith is the Platonic view.
That is, God knows all things and is unchanging.
If you were to remove any bit of knowledge from God then He would be less than perfect and, therefore, not God.

The problem with this Hellenistic view of God (strict, total immutability) is that the Bible does not support it.


## Problematic Texts

There are several texts in the Bible that seem to support the Platonic view of God.
There are also several texts that seem to support that God changes His mind.
Before we examine these texts lets think about some underlying issues and presumptions.

### Proof-Texting

Proof-texting is a popoular practice of taking snippets of scripture to support a doctrine.
The issue here is that the Bible is not written with singular texts devoted to particular doctrines.
Important doctrines are scattered throughout various narratives, poems, and prose.
We are meant to discover the doctrines of God through meditation on the whole of scripture- not ferreting out pieces that support our ideas.

### Verse Numbers

The verse numbers in the Bible are not inspired.
It is truly foolish to base a doctrine on scripture which is extracted based on an arbitrary numbering system.
This is especially true when then issue at hand is a dogma of the faith.
Whenever a single verse is given as "proof" we should immediately goto the context of the surrounding verses for the author's meaning.

### The Son

Jesus is God and man.
To argue about immutability by distinguishing between Father and Son is at best inconsistent and flawed- at worst heretical.
The Son Himself is literally an incarnation of God's changing...but let us save that digression for below...
To have a faith wherein Jesus is not God, or not man, is not a Biblical faith.

### Back to Plato

So, if the following texts support that God does indeed change does that mean that God is not perfect?
No, not if we accept that God is a living being with a complex nature.

### Mind vs Character et Nature

Both humans and God have physical, mental, and spiritual natures.
This is kind of the point of the B&W Mary story we started with and we see God's physical and mental nature in many passages (read Abraham, Gideon, Jacob, etc.)
The crus of this issue is that God's character and mind are not necessarily one thing.
God's character is clearly fixed for all time.
God's mind and heart may change based on His interactions with His creation.
God's physical nature clearly changes with His intentions.

### Unnarrative

The Bible is a collection of narratives, poetry, and prose.
Just as we shouldn't yank snippets of scriptures based on verse numbers, we shouldn't apply a narrative interpretation to a poetic text, or vice versa.
The Bible authors do not stop, mid-narrative, to wax eloquent about metaphysics while remaining in the narrative style.
There are times when a narrative breaks to present a poem but these are obvious and are parsable as poetry.
Paul occassionally breaks his discourse to quote [or create] a poem...again, obviously.
Also, just because a piece of text makes sense in isolation in English does not mean that interpeting it thusly is valid- that is promoting our interpretation and presumption above the author's.
If we allow that then we may as well throw out exegesis altogether.
The desire to do so ought to be an indication that we need to pull back and look at larger contexts and other Bible texts for the author's intent.


Numbers 23:19
- Well, here is pretty clear statement that God does not change His mind.
- But, when we take the entire passage (vv18-24) we see that Balaam is speaking in the context of God's promises and character
- In light of the fact that God's promise-keeping requires response to human action- doesn't that mean that God must wait to act?  i.e. move through time...which is change.

1 Samuel 15:29
- "And also" implies that there is an important precedent text, let's include v.28;
- Samuel relates that God has _changed_ the leadership of the kingdom **specifically because** His character does not change.
- There may also be an implication that God, indeed, has regret but doesn't want it.
- Does it make more sense that God's unchanging character goes hand-in-hand with His changing mind?

Malachi 3:6
- Again, if we take the entire paragraph (at least through v.7) we see that something about God does not change...but something does.
- In verse 6 God is speaking about His character and promises are immutable for the sake of His people.
- In verse 7 God's position with His people is changing- in fact, it changes based on the actions of the people!

James 1:17
- Taken out of context this single verse is all about immutability.
- Taking vv.16-18 does not really solve the issue, if we have a problem with immutability, because James underlines the notion of God's unchanging character but making no mention of God's actions.
- In itself this passage may, indeed, support immutability;
- However, in light of other scriptures, it does not reject the notion that God can change His mind because this passage, and the greater context, is about sin and living a holy life- such a thing requires the immutable character of God and the changing mind of God to forget our sin and moprh us into a holy creature.

Psalm 102:27
- Indeed, God does not change; this poetic language is more an indication of the human's understanding of God's fundamental nature.
- There is, in context, an understanding of God affecting change in our world for His purposes (in this case: drawing a human to Hisself.)
- The phrases "You will remain" (v.26) and "You are the same" (v.27) are not necessarily indicative of total immutability of God's entire self...especially in light of other scriptures and the author's poetic licensure.

Hebrews 13:8
- Exactly what about Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever?
- Jesus was incarnated as an infant, grew into a man, was scarred, died, was resurrected
- It seems pretty clear that that lack of change described in Hebrews is about part of Jesus' nature and not [at least] the physical part of it.

...WHATISMORE...

Luke 2:52
- Jesus "increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man."
- It was God[flesh] and humanity and God[divine] all changing together.
  - Did the Holy Spirit not change?  He is not mentioned here...

Psalms 33:11
- Suffice to say "the counsel of the LORD" is not the same thing as the LORD Himself.
- This (obviously) could go either way but, perhaps, seems to indicate this distinction between God's self and His actor.
  - An ancillary idea: if I say "I am thirsty, I'm going to get myself a drink of water." who is talking to who?  This divide between mind and materiel is not a purely human indication...

Jeremiah 15:6
- The LORD's weariness at giving _chance after chance_ to His people indicates His participation in time and change.
- The question is whether He is actually changing: it could be that the "relenting acts" were just part of the pre-written plan but, if so, what is wearying and relentable about it?

Jeremiah 18:8
- As above, we have a situtation where God is reacting to human action by refraining from doing what He said He would do...namely, destroying the wicked.

Jonah 3:10
- Here we go even deeper into the immutability arguments because we have indications, throughout Jonah's story, that God's character seems to _require_ both the promise of destruction and the promise of forgiveness.
- The choice between the two comes down to human action, as forecast by Divine perspiration.
- The fact that God emotes and reacts and yearns indicates His presence in our world in addition to His connection with a higher, unchanging character.

Exodus 34:6
- Perhaps the most poignant, narrative example of God's determination to redeem humanity and simultaneously uphold His own character.
- If His character was fickleness, self-actualization, and agrandizment then it would be impossible to allow for human missteps- as it is, His [by His own word] mercy, frace, patience, love, and faithfulness all presume this duality of indomitable character and flexible presentation.

1 Corinthians 13:8
~ This passage is full of love-verbs that require change
- regret, joy, perseverance, faith, hope, and endurance all imply a flow of time and living with aspect and tense necessitate change.

Romans 8:34 + Hebrews 7:25
- If all is predestined and foreknown then what point is there in praying for us?
- You might make the case for human prayer as a conformation and sanctification _by_ God- but then what is the point of Jesus' intercession?


## Emoting and Creative Allowance

God is not a machine, He interacts with humans and allows us to be free and innovative.
The Bible clearly teaches that God loves and delights in us and our good works.
This very idea necessitates that God is capable of changing _His mind_.

God is forgiving, He has planned for our adoption into His family since before the universe existed.
The Bible clearly teaches that God loves and forgives His enemies, even to the point of sacrificing His own life for them.
This very idea necessitates that God is incapable of changing _His character_.
