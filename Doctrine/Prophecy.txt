Prophecy


[Acts 17:11]
[1Jon 2:27]
[Matt 6:6]
Puns & Multiple Interpretation


[Num 12:6]
	all prophets but Moses received λογος in a dream


God has both a conditional and an unconditional will
- His unconditional will is incontrovertible and immutable
- His conditional will waits on us - or whatever else He may want
e.g. prayer: God may respond to prayer because He desires our involvement


Multiple Fulfillment
e.g. the abomination of desolation in Daniel meshes well with Antiochus Epiphanes actions during the Maccabean Era but...it is a not perfect Fulfillment - that part it yet to come.


Partial Fulfillment
- Already but Not Yet
- there are plenty of instances where prophecies are partly fulfilled
~ a close cousin of this is scripture that partly applies to us
	e.g. OT references to God's children may be about Israel but point to greater truths that apply to us.


Puns
- this is a term that has a double meaning
