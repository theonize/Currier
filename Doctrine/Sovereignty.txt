Sovereignty
...government free from external control
  "God is in control"

<Control, Authority, Presence>

dominion
...regional legal authority

A __sovereign__ is a king or Lord.  The monarchy is implied.  Americans misunderstand and, therefore, misrepresent these ideas because we live in an oligarchy.

At times God seems to relinquich control.  Does this mean He is not control any more?  How can he be in control if I am also?
  "Permissive Will"
  We are unbalanced, God is balanced.
  Sovereignty in all things
  We want to know but God withholds some things.
  Can we accept our limited understanding? and not judge Him based on our paradigm?

Deism ~ the idea that God set everything into motion and watches it unfold.

Our response to His sovereignty:
- [Is 45:9-10]()
  [Rom 9:21]()
  ...the potter to the clay
  ...the fetus to the womb

- [John 21:19-23]()
  ...

- [Gen 1:1]()


Gods means
- We cannot **invoke* God
- He does His will as He wants


Gods goals
