Sovereignty
...government free from external control
  "God is in control"

<Control, Authority, Presence>

dominion
...regional legal authority

A __sovereign__ is a king or Lord.  The monarchy is implied.  Americans misunderstand and, therefore, misrepresent these ideas because we live in an oligarchy- under the pretense of federal, republican democracy.

At times God seems to relinquish control.  How can he be in control of everything if I am in control of some things?
  "Permissive Will"
  We are unbalanced, God is balanced.
  Sovereignty in all things, and also free will for creatures, means reality cannot be deterministic and finite- there must be a continual influx of information.
  We want to know but God withholds all things which we don't need- this life is all about Him wooing us to freely join Him (the next is about more than that.)
  Can we accept our limited understanding? and not judge Him based on our paradigm?

Deism ~ the idea that God set everything into motion and watches it unfold.
  This idea is fundamnetally flawed because, without a continual influc of new information into our universe there can because no change.
  God is continually involved in His creation.
  e.g. Israel
  e.g. The Church

  ...the potter to the clay
