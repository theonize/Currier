* John 3:14 - 
  * As the bronze serpent Jesus/"I" will be lifted up
* John 8:32 - 
  * _When_ I am lifted up
  * I/Jesus will draw all men
  * ...one day every knee will bow, Isaiah 45:23
* Matthew 4:5-10 - 
  * Jesus was lifted up twice
    * to the Pinnacle of the temple
    * to a very high mountain
  * ...by "the devil"
