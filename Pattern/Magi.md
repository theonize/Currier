# Magi

The Magi are a group of wisdom seekers from the East who are mentioned in the Bible.
They are known for their study of the stars and their ability to interpret dreams.
The Magi are often associated with the story of the birth of Jesus, as they are said to have followed a star to find the newborn king.
They are also associated with Daniel who is, in some minds, the progenitor of that sect.
The Magi of the Bible were attuned to heavenly signs of the Messiah's coming and carried a tradition coupled with Jewish/Yahwist cult & belief.
