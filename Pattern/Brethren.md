# Brethren

Often we find words like _adelphos_ which means brothers.

While this is literally "men" it has a synecdochetic meaning. 
Brothers, fathers, sons, et al are often used referential for family units. 
In a congregational setting it is the norm for brothers to refer to the family units. 

So, while it may disrupt our modern suffrage sensibilities "brothers" is not meant to divide but to include.
It is the man and his family. 
For insurance: in my day it was common to hear an introduction like, "Mister and Misses John Doe."
In accident time the family unit was not just important it was sacrosanct.

We see a similar, but opposite, pattern in _elders_.
Elders are literally just old people...but in the leadership context, in the ancient world, it was exclusively male.
