Magic


TOREAD: Clinton Arnold


In this day and age we tend to think of magic as a mysterious, arcane art of the ancients that is long dead.
We tend to think that they were less evolved than us and their belief in magic was simply a misunderstanding of scientific fundamentals.
Robert Sawyer even goes so far as to say that all those who tend to ascribe spiritual/supernatural significance to happenings have an inferior brain structure (loosely coupled lobes).

All of this thinking is absurd.
Reality is, in fact, stranger than even ancient people imagined - and provably so via quantum mechanics.

Furthermore we (all we's in fact) tend to perform some version of sympathetic magic.
The Christian who believes that God's work depends on their prayer or work is attempting to perform sympathetic magic.
However, the minister who teaches anything of this sort is apostate and grievously unbiblical.
The materialist who is dogmatic in their belief of the effects of their causes is also performing sympathetic magic.
The minister who teachs such an esoteric art is certainly the more honest of the two and betrays a preternatural faith.
...esoteric meaning private, or internal, mysteries- not as in the vernacular which equates the term with __occult__.

The Christian perspective of magic typically falls into two camps:
- the eye-rollers
- the haters
...both are dangerous.

We shan't deny the supernatural nature of existence.
We must also come to embrace the absolute sovereignty and final decreetive will of Yahweh.
Any less and [I fear] the best we can hope for is a blanding of life's work contributing nothing stark to an anesthitized world.
Amy more and we risk being sucked into the debilitating realm of "my will".

Importantly, though we cannot deny the power of self fulfilling prophecy, Providence, and miracle.


The Bible expressly forbids three types of magic:
* divination, particularly trying to "tell" the future
* blood magic and necromancy
  * Acts 15 ~ the blood of stangled things is not only linked to worship of false gods but also to an undermining of God's established order of supernatural revelation and intervention.
* pharmakeia ~ the use of drugs/substances to artifically induce states of consciousness


Dean Radin (a notable agnostic) divides magic into three categories:
* divination
* force of will
* theurgy ~ the use of ritual to invoke supernatural beings or powers

Divination in order to tell the future or see beyond our realm is forbidden in the Bible.
However, working in accordance with God and communing with Him is also divination and is a healthy part of the Christian life.
Theosis is the systematic theological term for the divination of the human.
Such an outcome is actually and important facet of faith but it is not driven by our work but by God's.

Force-of-Will is more expressly recorded in the Bible.
The pitfall of many christian-flavored faiths is the idea that our work influences God's will and, as such, we can expect certain outcomes.
The opposite is, in fact, true.
God gives us power and thus enables us to do certain works by __our will__.
It stands to reason that the more aligned our purposes are the more powerful they will be.
Our lack of outcomes often stems from a lack of corporate buy-in and the incapacity to understand complexity.
It is often necessary for a congregation to be of "one mind" in order to see lack projects come to fruition.
We may pray for a grandiose miracle but fail to realize the amount of resources and human effort required to make it so.
Thus, it stands to reason that many people doing what they able (i.e. enabled) to do can perform much higher feats that the individual.

Communing with spirits is a splippery slope and is expressly forbidden in the Bible...except for one.
Just as God's faithful angels would refuse worship.
The unfaithful angels would accept and this is a sign that we should avoid them- because they have an intent that is not aligned with Yahweh's.
We are encouraged to commune with God.
* Matthew 6
* 1 Thessalonians 5
* 1 John 4
* 1 Corinthians 14
* 1 Corinthians 12
...but other spirits are to be avoided; such things not only separate us from God but open us to the danger of manipulations and intrigue meant for our destruction.


There are "magicks" which are recorded in the Bible as being associated with worship of Yahweh
* Holotropy ~ natural, non-chemical, methods of inducing altered states of consciousness
  * the human body is, through breathing and focus techniques, capable of producting chemicals that induce these states naturally.
  * 2 Cor ? ~ Paul's vision of heaven
  * Ezekiel
  * Isaiah
