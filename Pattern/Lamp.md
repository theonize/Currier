# Lamps

The eyes both emit and receive light, physically.
I posit that the light of the lamp is the physical manifestation of our true nature.
i.e. it's energy is seen in the "eyes" just like a flame is seen atop a candle ~ they are both at this point of high energy

The following discourse outlines the imbuing and conduction of "light" to the world ~ through the Church-members:
  [Matt 5:15]() ~ You are the light of the world
  ...teach the commandments
  ...cut off sinful nature
  ...understanding depravity
  ...true service
  ...humble/private giving [contrasted]
  [Matthew 6:22]() ~ The eye is the lamp of the body.
