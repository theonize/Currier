# Light 

Light is pure and...illuminating... ;p

Blamelessness, goodness, and righteousness are akin to "light"

It is most obviously this aspect of light that pertains to God.
However, there seems to also be a physical aspect of brilliant light to God
- He shines
- He blinds


As believers:
- you "are" light
- you "have" light
- you are "of" light

light "of" the eyes
light "in" the Lord
light is _sweet_

Yahweh is
- "as" light
- "gives" light

evil is akin to misconstruing light for darknes, v.v.
