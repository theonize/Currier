# Intelligence
...the ability to, and behavior of, comprehending, understanding, and profitting from experience

e.g. Humans can ingest information from text and visuals and give novel responses and create new information.

e.g. Slime-Mold can sense information in the form of ambient environmental characteristics and grows in a purposeful, optimal pattern.

e.g. Computers, particularly machine learning models, can ingest text and visuals and create novel responses.


What is the difference between human and machine intelligence?
Fundamentally, the difference is the scale and capacity of the intellect.
A machine has much more capacity for modeling information.
The distinctiveness of a human is in more than intellect.

An important aspect of sentience is the capability to use tools.
Using intelligent tools, and making more intelligent tools, should be a priority.
