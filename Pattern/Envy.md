# Envy

Solomon and the two prostitutes:
the envious mother would rather kill a child than give up her covetousness.


## Humility

Christians are subjects of envy because we have the Church and a personal relationship with a truly loving Being.
Both, or either, can be dispelled by offering the membership and relationship freely.
This is the gospel.
Envy evaporates when charity is dispensed.
