The goal of a parable was not to cloak the truth but to make it digestable.

None of the underlying truths, or imagery, of the parables is new with Jesus- it is all OT Biblical stuff.

You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
You can tell someone the truth but you can't make them believe it.
They must wrestle with it themselves.

In fact, the means of communicating via parable is an OT tradition in itself.
- e.g. Nathan's rebuke of David
- e.g. the vineyard of Isaiah 5
- e.g. the prodigal Hosea 11


The meaning of a parable is whatever the storyteller meant.
The significance of a parable is however the listener applies that meaning.
