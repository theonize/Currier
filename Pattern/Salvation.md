# Salvation

Salvation is to be saved.


## Saved from what?

Biblical theology says that we are hopelessly debased by nature- our original, divinely purposed, nature was spoiled through rebellion.


## Saved how?

The nature of "original sin", or human debasement, is that it requires a fundamental change in being.
Only the creator can perform this act.

However, we are not extricated from Earth upon being rebased.
The Earth itself is our final destination and is scheduled for refit.
Also, there are other people who need to receive our testimony.

So, we have a sense of having been saved- the fundamental nature changed.
We have a sense of being saved- we are sanctified to overcome our old self.
We have a sense that we will be saved- one day the final resurrection of all things.
These are the tenses of salvation.
It is the process of a lifetime.
