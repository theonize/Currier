# The Hem


Like today's military folk often wear rank insignia on the sleeve or collar, in ancient times it was on the hem of the robe.

The hem was not only an indication of status but denoted the character of the wearer.
The hem was also a sign of authority, so cutting off the hem was a sign of stripping someone of authority.
