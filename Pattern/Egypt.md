# Egypt


Egypt is a real place...and is one of the oldest continuous civilizations in the world.

Egypt is, in the Bible, symbolic of the world.
- The people of God are seen retreating to Egypt for false security and God has to forcibly bring them out of it.


What kind of transformation did the Exodus reap in Egypt?
- There was great plunder, most "money" stuffs were taken ~ but the Egyptians had their [Josephian] infrastructure and fertile agricultural lands.
