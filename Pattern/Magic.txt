Magic


TOREAD: Clinton Arnold


In this day and age we tend to think of magic as a mysterious, arcane art of the ancients that is long dead.
We tend to think that they were less evolved than us and their belief in magic was simply a misunderstanding of scientific fundamentals.
Robert Sawyer even goes so far as to say that all those who tend to ascribe spiritual/supernatural significance to happenings have an inferior brain structure (loosely coupled lobes).

All of this thinking is absurd.
Reality is, in fact, stranger than even ancient people imagined - and provably so via quantum mechanics.

Furthermore we (all we's in fact) tend to perform some version of sympathetic magic.
The Christian who believes that God's work depends on their prayer or work is attempting to perform sympathetic magic.
The minister who teaches anything of this sort is apostate and grievously unbiblical.
The materialist who is dogmatic in their belief of the effects of their causes is also performing sympathetic magic.
The minister who teachs this esoteric art is certainly the more honest of the two and betrays a preternatural faith.

The Christian perspective of magic typically falls into two camps:
- the eye-rollers
- the haters

...both are dangerous.
We shan't deny the supernatural nature of existence.
We must also come to embrace the absolute sovereignty and final decreetive will of Yahweh.
Any less and [I fear] the best we can hope for is a bland life's work contributing nothing stark to an anesthitized world.
Amy more and we risk being sucked into the debilitating realm of "my will".

Importantly, though we cannot deny the power of self fulfilling prophecy, Providence, and miracle.
