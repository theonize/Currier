Pattern
 = something that illustrates a doctrine.


A pattern may be a tangible item or it may be an atomic, ammoral idea.

An example:
	[Bread] is a common thing from all time.  Jesus used bread as a metaphor for Hisself as the revealed λογος.  This has many implications about the ubiquity of His truth and His provision for us.

	[Chronology] is emperical.  We exist in an ever progressing series of events.  The fact of this in conjunction with the notion that other modes of existence are possible allows us to begin thinking about God.

Some aspects of patterns used in this context:
	- ammoral (neither good nor bad)
	- ethical (has some bearing on doctrine)
	- lesson (exposits truth through simile, metaphor, or allegory linguistically or physically)


Obfuscation
	One unfortunate side-effect of modern translation techniques, which attempt to impart cultural equivalence, is that subtleties are hidden and patterns get munged.
	It would nice if there were varying grades of translations which would graduate a reader into a more literal reading when have a deeper understanding of the original philological context.
