## Notes on the Notes

Most verse reference are empty hyperlinks: [Ref]()
* Hopefully this makes them easier to find and gives the ability to fill in programtically
* Some of the older stuff may still use {curlies} to identify references


At some point I started using a revised form of the Michigan/Claremont Hebrew transliteration:

A B G D H V Z K + ' C L M N S Y P t Q R $ T


The Greek is easier but has some two-letter equivalents:

a b g d e z y th i k l m n ch o p r s t u ph x ps w
