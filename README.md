## About

We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Any seemingly novel or particularly poignant insight hereabouts is most likely not my own.
Any uncannily weird or off-the-wall idea is probably mine.
Suffice to say my mission in life is to proclaim the power of Jesus life, death, and resurrection because it means redemption for all people and things.
This is a collection of Bible-related notes and thoughts that will hopefully stir the right nerd and the dorkiest time to yearn for Christ.
