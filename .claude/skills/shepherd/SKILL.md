# My Skill

Research and determine the context of a Biblical passage by answering the following questions:
* Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience
* Who? my audience is contemporary suburban Texans ranging in age from 6th grade to twilight
* What attributes or actions, of theirs, must change according to this Word?
* When would we do these things?
* Where might we do these things?
* How would the current audience implement these changes?
* Meaning versus method: how might I accomplish these things?
