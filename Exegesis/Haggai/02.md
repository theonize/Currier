1 In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet: 2 “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say, 3 ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? 4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the Lord. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the Lord. Work, for I am with you, declares the Lord of hosts, 5 according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not. 6 For thus says the Lord of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land. 7 And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts. 8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the Lord of hosts. 9 The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the Lord of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the Lord of hosts.’”

Blessings for a Defiled People
10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, 11 “Thus says the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests about the law: 12 ‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food, does it become holy?’” The priests answered and said, “No.” 13 Then Haggai said, “If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?” The priests answered and said, “It does become unclean.” 14 Then Haggai answered and said, “So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, declares the Lord, and so with every work of their hands. And what they offer there is unclean. 15 Now then, consider from this day onward.[a] Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the Lord, 16 how did you fare? When[b] one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty. 17 I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail, yet you did not turn to me, declares the Lord. 18 Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid, consider: 19 Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing. But from this day on I will bless you.”

Zerubbabel Chosen as a Signet
20 The word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, 21 “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth, 22 and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall go down, every one by the sword of his brother. 23 On that day, declares the Lord of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel, declares the Lord, and make you like a[c] signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the Lord of hosts.”

## Context
- **Canonical**: Post-exilic prophetic book; contemporary with Zechariah; follows the return under Cyrus's decree (Ezra 1)
- **Immediate**: Three oracles delivered in 520 BC—second year of Darius I—addressing discouragement over the temple's modest appearance
- **Literary setting**: Follows chapter 1's rebuke; shifts from correction to encouragement and eschatological promise

## History/Culture
- **Date**: October 17, 520 BC (v.1); December 18, 520 BC (vv.10, 20)
- **Political**: Persian Empire under Darius I; Judah a small province; Zerubbabel as Davidic governor, Joshua as high priest
- **Social**: Returned remnant (~50,000) struggling economically; elders remembered Solomon's temple destroyed 66 years prior
- **Religious**: Temple foundation laid but work stalled for ~16 years; priestly instruction still authoritative

## Language
- **Key terms**: חֶמְדַּת (ḥemdat) "treasures/desire" (v.7)—debated messianic reference; חוֹתָם (ḥôtām) "signet ring" (v.23)—royal authority symbol
- **Repetition**: "declares the LORD of hosts" (23x in Haggai)—emphasizes divine authority; "be strong" (חֲזַק) triple command (v.4)
- **Priestly torah**: Technical purity language in vv.11-13 (holy/unclean transmission)

## Literature
- **Structure**: Three dated oracles—(1) vv.1-9 glory of the temple; (2) vv.10-19 holiness/defilement lesson; (3) vv.20-23 Zerubbabel's election
- **Genre**: Prophetic oracle with priestly torah inquiry
- **Devices**: Rhetorical questions (v.3); chiastic "shake" passages (vv.6-7, 21-22); reversal of Jehoiachin's signet rejection (Jer 22:24)

## Hermeneutic
- **Typological**: Zerubbabel as Davidic type pointing to Messiah; second temple's greater glory fulfilled in Christ's presence (John 2:19-21)
- **Eschatological**: "Yet once more" (v.6) cited in Hebrews 12:26-27 for final cosmic shaking
- **Covenantal**: Spirit promise links Sinai covenant (v.5) to new covenant presence
- **Reversal pattern**: Signet ring reverses Coniah's curse; blessing reverses agricultural judgment

## Application
- **Encouragement in humble beginnings**: God values faithfulness over outward appearance
- **Presence over prosperity**: "I am with you" (v.4) and "My Spirit remains" (v.5) as primary comfort
- **Holiness principle**: Contamination spreads more readily than holiness—requires intentional sanctification
- **Obedience precedes blessing**: vv.15-19 tie agricultural reversal to recommitment to God's work
- **Identity in God's choice**: Significance comes from being chosen (v.23), not from circumstances
