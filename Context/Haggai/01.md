Haggai 1:12-15 (ESV)
```
Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord.  Then Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke to the people with the Lord's message, “I am with you, declares the Lord.”  And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

# Context

This passage marks the turning point in Haggai's prophecy—the people's response to God's rebuke in 1:1-11. The temple reconstruction had been abandoned for approximately 16 years since the initial return under Cyrus's decree (538 BC). The work stopped due to Samaritan opposition (Ezra 4) and the people's misplaced priorities (building their own paneled houses while God's house lay in ruins).

The date markers are significant: Haggai's initial oracle came on the first day of the sixth month (1:1), and the people responded 23 days later on the twenty-fourth day.  This suggests a period of deliberation, preparation, and organization before work commenced.
  23 days is a short time to mobilize a community for a large construction project, indicating the urgency and wholeheartedness of their response- may have allowed for consultation with Persian authorities.  Being in the 6th month indicates it may have been the harvest.  The end of this period may have been the new moon festival (1 Kings 6:1), a fitting time to begin temple work.  Possibly aligned with the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) on the 10th of the 7th month, a time of repentance and renewal.  The number itself is not explicitly symbolic, underlining historical specificity.

Zerubbabel and Joshua represent the two pillars of post-exilic leadership: civil (governor) and religious (high priest). Their dual leadership foreshadows the messianic expectation of priest-king unity.


# History/Culture

**Persian Period Context**
- Darius I (Hystaspes) reigned 522-486 BC; his second year = 520 BC
- Darius was favorable to temple reconstruction, later issuing a decree supporting it (Ezra 6:1-12)
  - An empire-wide policy of religious patronage to legitimize rule
- The title "governor" (פֶּחָה, pechah) is a Persian administrative term

**The Remnant (שְׁאֵרִית, she'erit)**
- Technical term for those who survived judgment and returned
- Approximately 50,000 returned under Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:64-65)
- Represents covenant continuity despite exile—God preserved a seed

**Zerubbabel's Lineage**
- Grandson of King Jehoiachin (deported 597 BC)
- Davidic heir, though not king—Persians appointed governors
- His name means "seed of Babylon" (זְרֻבָּבֶל)—born in exile

**Joshua ben Jehozadak**
- His father Jehozadak was taken captive when Jerusalem fell (1 Chron 6:15)
- First high priest of the Second Temple period
- Represents priestly continuity from the Zadokite line


# Linguistics

**"Obeyed the voice" (שָׁמַע בְּקוֹל)**
- More than hearing; active compliance, hearkening
- Same construction as Deuteronomic covenant language (Deut 28:1-2)
- The preposition בְּ intensifies: listened "into" the voice

**"Feared" (יָרֵא)**
- Not terror but reverent awe
- Often paired with covenant obedience in Deuteronomy
- Represents proper orientation to YHWH's holiness

**"Messenger" (מַלְאָךְ, mal'ak)**
- Same word for "angel"—one sent with a message
- Haggai is the only prophet explicitly called YHWH's mal'ak in his narrative
- Emphasizes the divine origin of his words

**"Stirred up" (עוּר, 'ur)**
- Hiphil form: caused to awaken, aroused
- Same verb used for Cyrus (Isa 41:2, 25; 45:13)
- God initiates the spiritual motivation—human response follows divine enabling

**"Spirit" (רוּחַ, ruach)**
- Repeated three times: Zerubbabel's, Joshua's, the people's
- Encompasses will, motivation, inner disposition
- Divine sovereignty working through human agency

**"House of the LORD of hosts" (בֵּית יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת)**
- "LORD of hosts" (Sabaoth) emphasizes God's cosmic kingship
- Occurs 14 times in Haggai—characteristic of post-exilic prophets
- The temple is not merely a building but the dwelling of the universe's sovereign


# Literary

**Structure**
The passage forms a chiastic response to 1:1-11:
- A: God speaks through prophet (1:1) → A': People obey prophet's words (1:12)
- B: Rebuke for neglecting temple (1:2-11) → B': "I am with you" (1:13)
- C: Call to consider (1:5, 7) → C': God stirs their spirits (1:14)
- D: Command implied → D': Work commences (1:14-15)

**Repetition of Names and Titles**
Full names and titles appear twice (vv. 12, 14):
- Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah
- Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest
- The remnant of the people

This repetition creates literary emphasis and solemnity—a formal record of covenant renewal.

**Narrative Compression**
Verse 13 is remarkably brief—the shortest prophetic oracle recorded. "I am with you" (אֲנִי אִתְּכֶם) contains the entire covenantal promise in four Hebrew words. This brevity contrasts with the lengthy rebuke, suggesting grace exceeds judgment.

**Chronological Precision**
The specific dating (24th day, 6th month, 2nd year of Darius) anchors the spiritual event in verifiable history.  Haggai is the most precisely dated book in the OT.


# Theology

**Divine Initiative and Human Response**
The sequence is theologically significant:
1. God rebukes (1:1-11)
2. People obey and fear (1:12)
3. God encourages: "I am with you" (1:13)
4. God stirs spirits (1:14)
5. People work (1:14-15)

Grace precedes and enables obedience. The people's fear (v. 12) is followed by assurance (v. 13); their willingness is then empowered by divine stirring (v. 14).

**"I Am With You" (אֲנִי אִתְּכֶם)**
- Echoes the patriarchal promises (Gen 26:3; 28:15; 31:3)
- Echoes the Mosaic commission (Exod 3:12)
- Echoes the Davidic covenant (2 Sam 7:9)
- The presence of God is the essential covenant blessing

This is Immanuel theology: God dwelling with His people. The temple is the architectural expression of this reality.

**The Spirit's Work**
God "stirred up" (עוּר) the spirits of leaders and people alike. This demonstrates:
- Regeneration: new motivation from divine source
- Sovereignty: God accomplishes His purposes through renewed wills
- Unity: leaders and people moved together

Compare Ezra 1:1, 5 where God similarly "stirred up" Cyrus and the returnees.

**Covenant Renewal Pattern**
The passage follows the classic pattern:
1. Prophetic word delivered
2. Corporate response of obedience
3. Divine affirmation of relationship
4. Empowerment for service

This mirrors Sinai (Exod 19-24) and Josiah's reform (2 Kings 22-23).


# Application

**Obedience Precedes Assurance**
The people obeyed (v. 12) before receiving the comforting word "I am with you" (v. 13).  Often believers seek assurance before committing to obedience.  The pattern here reverses that: step out in faith, then experience God's confirming presence.

**Leadership Matters**
Zerubbabel and Joshua led the response.  Spiritual renewal typically requires leaders who model obedience.  Their prominence in the text (named twice with full titles) emphasizes accountability— leaders are named when they lead well.

**Community Project**
The temple was a corporate endeavor requiring unified effort. Individual believers needed the community; the community needed individual participation. "All the remnant" worked together. Modern applications:
- Local church building (spiritual and physical)
- Missions requiring collective resources
- Any kingdom work too large for individuals

**God Empowers What He Commands**
The stirring of spirits (v. 14) demonstrates that God does not merely demand—He enables.  When facing daunting tasks, believers can trust that the God who calls also equips. The work began not from human enthusiasm alone but from divinely renewed motivation.

**Delays Can End**
Sixteen years of inactivity ended in 23 days.  Past failure does not preclude future faithfulness.  The text records no condemnation for the delay once repentance occurred—only encouragement and empowerment.


# Hermeneutic

**Literal-Historical Reading**
The passage records actual events with precise dating.  The names, titles, and chronology are meant to be taken as historical record.  This is not allegory but redemptive history.

**Typological Significance**
- Zerubbabel as Davidic heir points to Christ the King
- Joshua as high priest points to Christ the Priest
- The temple reconstruction anticipates the true temple (John 2:19-21)
- The remnant foreshadows the faithful church

**Canonical Placement**
Haggai could be read alongside Ezra 5-6 (historical context) and Zechariah 1-8 (contemporary prophecy, two months later).  The three sources illuminate each other.

**Application Principle**
The "I am with you" promise, while given to post-exilic Israel, participates in a covenantal pattern that extends to the church (Matt 28:20; Heb 13:5).  The specific historical promise carries theological continuity for God's people in every age.

**Christological Reading**
The temple Haggai encouraged them to build was the one Christ would enter (Hag 2:7-9).  The "latter glory" greater than the former was fulfilled not in architectural grandeur but in the incarnate presence of God Himself walking its courts.
