# The Process

Read yourself full
Talk/Think yourself empty
Write yourself clear
  Alistair Begg

This quip is not original, but it is a summation of the act of studying that will help us in our learning.

When we do these 3 things we will incorporate all the pieces we talked about in the overview.
We start small and easy and work into the more difficult, in-depth things.
We start with a study goal: are studying for a test? looking to connect with people? trying to accomplish something?
We will flow through this process multiple times as our reading and writing get more in-depth.
Throughout the flow of reading, then writing, repeating, we will revisit our goal.
If we have met our goal then we are done.
If we later decide to come back to this study then we can re-read ourselves and start right back.


## Begin

Answer these questions:

  What am I studying? ___
  
  Why am I studying it? ___


## Phase 1

Skim the material.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write a narrative about what the material: as if telling someone else it's story.

Take a break from it (could be an hour, a day, or more.)


## Phase 2

Intake the material, try to pickup the details you skimmed over before.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write a one-sentence explanation of the passage.
Then, write less than a full page of words or pictures to flesh out your explanation.

Take a break from it (could be an hour, a day, or more.)


## Phase 3

Digest the material, to understand the meaning of every word and glean every idea.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write an analysis of the material.
This is where we start to pull at the different threads of the material's tapestry:
- Who was it written to?
- Why was it written?
- How was it originally formed?
- What impact has it had? are there other interesting analyses of it?

Take a break from it (could be an hour, a day, or more.)


## Phase 4

Analyze the material, gain an understanding of ancillary works that the influenced the original.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write teaching materials about this work.
- Give an overview of what you are studying.
- Point out the important and/or difficult pieces of the material
- Give some guidance on what concepts are there to be studied in depth.
- Push toward other works or ideas that will magnify their understanding of this work.



  If you come up with a complete way to do this on your own then that will probably be the best- as long as it covers all the aspects.
  A good, general way to do this is:
  * Write a thesis
    - one sentence that introduces the entirety of the topic
    - If you cannot present the topic in one simple sentence then you need to continue wrestling with it until you can
  * Write an outline or a couple paragraphs introducing all the elements of the topic
  * Write out the details
    - Best to put in all the nitty-gritty after introducing the various pieces
    - A potentially helpful remembrall is, "tell them what your going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them."
  * Re-write until you get it
    - If you cannot explain it simply [the thesis] then you don't really grasp the concept
    - If you cannot give details then you don't fully understand it
    - It can always be better, but at some point it's not bad
    - It may help to imagine that you begin by explaining to someone very simple, then progress to discussing to someone wiser and wiser
