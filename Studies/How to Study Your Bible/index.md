# How to Study Your Bible

[Acts 17:11]
[1Jon 2:27]
[Matt 6:6]
[Prov 1:5-7]


Ostensibly, though we are focusing on the Bible, this study method applies broadly.
Studying is: reading, thinking, and writing about a subject.
This study method strives to be:
- easy to remember
- easy to implement
- easy to pick up where you left off

Some things that will help you study well are:
- Telling others what you are studying so you can be accountable and muse with them.
- Setting aside a specific, consistent time to study (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Have a goal for your entire study.
- Have a goal for each study session.
  - If you meet this goal and want to continue, go ahead.
  - Don't stop until you've met this goal, if the goal is too lofty then change it **next time**
  - If you are part of a class then you have an assigned goal...add your own to it.

Phases of studying:
- Reading
- Thinking
- Writing
- Analyzing
