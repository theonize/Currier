# Reading

There are four types of reading:
- Skimming
- Intaking
- Digesting
- Applying

These need to be done in order.
However, if your outcome does not demand it, you may skip later steps.
e.g. if you are studying familiar material
e.g. you are not interested in the subject (you are compelled to study it)
Remember this: not all writings are worth all these levels of inquiry.
i.e. this is why the Bible is a great place to learn to study: because it is worth all efforts put against it.

## Skimming

Skimming is like drifting through a book or article.
You are just letting your eyes and mind pick out high level concepts.
Do not let yourself pore over a passage.
Do not let yourself linger on words or phrases (even if they're interesting.)

## Intaking

Intaking material means reading every word.
When this is done after skimming you already have the general idea and your mind can start to fill in the gaps.

## Digesting

Digesting is a more thorough reading.
This is where you will start using a dictionary and other resource materials.
Digesting means pulling apart a work into it's component pieces.

## Applying

Application of a work means you let it change your mind.
Now you will start pulling in related works to supplement your understanding.
i.e. read through the footnotes and gloss
i.e. if another work is cited, go read that work
