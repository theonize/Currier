# Writing

There are three styles of writing you will need when studying:
- Narrative
- Explanatory
- Teaching


## Narration

Narration is, in essence, story-telling.
Your narrative needs to tell the big concepts and main points of a work.


## Explanatory

Explaining a work is essential to real understanding.
If you cannot explain is simply, you do not truly understand it
You should strive to sum up a work in a single sentence;
and then, explain it in no more than one page of notes, diagrams, etc.


## Teaching

A teaching work is intended for others.
This is where you are giving what you have learned for the benefit of others.
It is not necessarily final, but it is the culmination of your studies and is the pinnacle of understanding.
