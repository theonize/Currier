# Thinking

For our purposes there are three types of critical thinking:
- Associative
- Inductive
- Deductive

We will be cognizant of all of these tracks for our trains of thought throughout all phases of study.
You may be the type who talks or moves or doodles while thinking: do these things on purpose to give yourself a framework to think within.


## Association

We cannot help but make associations.
This is how the human mind and brain works with reality.
The foundation of thought and memory is to learn to associate certain ideas with others.

* Make note of ideas, people, places, and things that stand out to you
* Write down these trails of association so you can follow them back to the topic at hand


## Induction

Induction is where you start making a subject your own.
You put into it your experience and intellect to understand it.
You can think of this type of understanding as using a work within yourself.
Your life is the context in which you take in and process the ideas at play.
This may not be the intended meaning but it is a valid outcome of what the author gave you.




## Deduction

Deduction is where you begin to understand a work for what it is.
You are extracting the intended meaning and ideas from the work.
At this stage you are understanding the work in it's own context apart from yourself.
