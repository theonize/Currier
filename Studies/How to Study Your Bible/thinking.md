# Thinking

Obviously you cannot not think during study.
For our purposes there are three types of thinking that are important to realize:
- Associative
- Inductive
- Deductive
We will be cognizant of all of these tracks for our trains of thought throughout all phases of study.
You may be the type who talks or moves or doodles while thinking: do these things on purpose to give yourself a framework to think within.

## Association

We cannot help but make associations.
This is how the human mind and brain work with reality.
The foundation of thought and memory is to learn to associate certain ideas with others.

## Induction

Induction is where you start making a subject your own.
You put into it your experience and intellect to understand it.
You can think of this type of understanding as using a work within yourself.
Your life is the context in which you take in and process the ideas at play.

## Deduction

Deduction is where you begin to understand a work for what it is.
You are extracting the intended meaning and ideas from the work.
At this stage you are understanding the work in it's own context apart from yourself.
