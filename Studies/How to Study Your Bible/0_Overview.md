# How to Study Your Bible

[Acts 17:11]
[1Jon 2:27]
[Matt 6:6]
[Prov 1:5-7]


Ostensibly, though we are focusing on the Bible this study method applies broadly.
Studying is: reading, thinking, and writing about a subject.
This study method strives to be:
- easy to remember
- easy to implement
- easy to pick up where you left off

Some things that will help you study well are:
- Telling others what you are studying so you can be accountable and muse with them.
- Set aside a specific, consistent time to study.
- Have a goal for your entire study.
- Have a goal for each study session.
  - If you meet this goal and want to continue, go ahead.
  - Don't stop until you've met this goal, if the goal is too lofty then change it **next time**

Elements of studying:
- Reading
- Thinking
- Writing
- Analyzing


## Reading

There are four types of reading:
- Skimming
- Intaking
- Digesting
- Applying

These need to be done in order.
However, if your outcome does not demand it, you may skip later steps.
e.g. if you are studying familiar material
e.g. you are not interested in the subject (you are compelled to study it)
Remember this: not all writings are worth all these levels of inquiry.
i.e. this is why the Bible is a great place to learn to study: because it is worth all efforts put against it.

### Skimming

Skimming is like drifting through a book or article.
You are just letting your eyes and mind pick out high level concepts.
Do not let yourself pore over a passage.
Do not let yourself linger on words or phrases (even if they're interesting.)

### Intaking

Intaking material means reading every word.
When this is done after skimming you already have the general idea and your mind can start to fill in the gaps.

### Digesting

Digesting is a more thorough reading.
This is where you will start using a dictionary and other resource materials.
Digesting means pulling apart a work into it's component pieces.

### Applying

Application of a work means you let it change your mind.
Now you will start pulling in related works to supplement your understanding.
i.e. read through the footnotes and gloss
i.e. if another work is cited, go read that work


## Thinking

Obviously you cannot not think during study.
For our purposes there are three types of thinking that are important to realize:
- Associative
- Inductive
- Deductive
We will be cognizant of all of these tracks for our trains of thought throughout all phases of study.
You may be the type who talks or moves or doodles while thinking: do these things on purpose to give yourself a framework to think within.

### Association

We cannot help but make associations.
This is how the human mind and brain work with reality.
The foundation of thought and memory is to learn to associate certain ideas with others.

### Induction

Induction is where you start making a subject your own.
You put into it your experience and intellect to understand it.
You can think of this type of understanding as using a work within yourself.
Your life is the context in which you take in and process the ideas at play.

### Deduction

Deduction is where you begin to understand a work for what it is.
You are extracting the intended meaning and ideas from the work.
At this stage you are understanding the work in it's own context apart from yourself.


## Writing

There are three styles of writing you will need when studying:
- Narrative
- Explanatory
- Analytical
- Teaching

### Narration

Narration is, in essence, story-telling.
Your narrative needs to tell the big concepts and main points of a work.

### Explanatory

Explaining a work is essential to real understanding.
If you cannot explain is simply, you do not truly understand it
You should strive to sum up a work in a single sentence;
and then, explain it in no more than one page of notes, diagrams, etc.

### Analysis

Analysis is really where you make a work your own.
Copying another's work through re-wording or paraphrase is not analysis,
it is to produce a new work that incorporates the original ideas in some useful manner.

### Teaching

A teaching work is intended for others.
This is where you are giving what you have learned for the benefit of others.
It is not necessarily final, but it is the culmination of your studies and is the pinnacle of understanding.


## Meaning

Extracting meaning from a passage consists of understanding four major aspects of the text.

Historical
Literary
Lexical
Theological

### Historical

When was it written?
Who wrote it?
WHo was the immediate audience?

### Literary

What is the writing style of the passage?
- Poetic
- Narrative

### Lexical

What are some important words in the passage?
How are those words used elsewhere in scripture?
- what is the first mention?
- what are the various translations of the word? why?

### Theological

What is the lesson given by the passage?
What is the placement of this lesson in an overall theme of scripture?
