# Identity & Crisis

Identity literally means "sameness".
When we talk aboutt our "identity" we are really expressing the perception of our true nature.
We do this by _identifying_ the various things we are the same as.

  For instance: I am a human, the same as other humans;  I am male, the same as other males;  I am American, the same as other Americans.
However, not all humans have ten fingers or two legs.
Regardless of that we perceive (rightly) a _human_ sameness despite the differences that make us distinguishable.
I am male because of my genetic structure.
However, my genetic structure is unique and does not share many properties with other male humans.
Likewise, I am American because I was born in the American territory.
This citizenship is not unqiue and I do not share many other identifying characteristics with other Americans.

  It is not only important to understand what identity is metaphysically but that its discovery elevates and illuminates our purpose.
Whatever it is we were made to do is both constrained by, and enhanced by, our identity.
Put another way- understanding our identity shines light on who we truly are, how we may interact with others, and how we deal with life.

Crisis literally means "turning point".
It was originally a Greek medical term referring to the _turning point_ in a disease.
e.g. that point in a flu where the fever may break...or not.  The patient is on the verge of recovery or death.
A crisis of identity is one that point where we discover something about ourselves that is unsettling.
That unsettled feeling is always a precursor to change, for better or worse.
This is actually a good thing.
There can be no courage with fear.
There can be no accumulation without struggle.


# Nature / Nurture

The story of Jacob reveals many things.
Here we will look at the providential development of his identity, character, and ability.
Regarding the question of whether identity is formed by nature or nurture, the answer is...yes.
We have talents and genes imbued by our creator.
We also have skills and knowledge input by experience.


## Genesis 25

  Jacob is a twin.
In utero he struggled with his brother and a prophecy was given [v.23] that these were two nascent nations and the younger would rule the older.
This fact providentially decided yet the declaration of it shaped Rebekah's attitude toward her sons.
The natural thing is the proclivity of the boys to struggle.
The nurture element is the treatment of the boys.

  Jacob means `usurper`.
Naming a child thus gives him a certain expectation.
They were raised in accordance with the parents expectation.
However, they also had tendencies: Esau was a macho outdoorsman, Jacob was a studious homebody.
Jacob's first usurpation comes when Esau is famished.
Jacob demands Esau's birthright in exchange for food and Esau agrees.
In this we see Jacob's character in action.
He is immature but acting according to who he is and how is being raised.
He is an opportunist, taking advantage of a situation for personal gain.


## Genesis 27

  Mother knows best.
This saying is loaded but we can take it [here] to mean that Rebekah is actively influencing events.
Isaac is expiring and ready to give his formal blessing: a right of survivorship which will pass on the headship of the family.
She intervenes and guides Jacob through a process to trick Isaac into blessing Jacob instead of Esau.
This is a formative experience for Jacob but remember that he is already over 40 years old.
He has been brought up in this way of scheming and plotting but Rebekah is also sacrificial [v.13]; she accepts responsibility as she guides him.

  The siblings are ruptured.
Isaac and Rebekah fear for Jacob's safety and send him away.
This is another formative experience for the man.
He will be gone for decades, living with the nagging estrangement from his twin brother.


## Genesis 28

  Jacob goes into the wilderness.
It is not a conincidence that many have met God in the wilderness.
It is when we are apart from the world and vulnerable that we are open to deepest influence by God.
The vision [v.12] sets the stage for Jacob's further development and includes a promise.
Jacob makes a conditional vow to God.
It does not appear that he is looking for a loophole, an exit strategy.
It is more like Jacob acknowledging that God is God if God does what He says He will do.
For [perhaps] the first time Jacob sees the providential orchestration and formation of his life.
God is moving him and, though Jacob cannot know precisely where or how, preserving him.


## Genesis 29

  Jacob arrives in Haran.
In his first encounter with the locals we see him giving direction but the shepherds correct him.
Then we are introduced the Rachel as Jacob swoons.
This is an interesting interplay of Jacob's natural inclinations butting up against reality.
Here, he is no one's favorite son and what he wants will not be handed to him.

  Jacob meets his match in Haran.
Jacob's uncle Laban has a similar character to Rebekah and Jacob- a schemer...and he has been doing it longer.
He is opportunistic, like Jacob, and strikes a deal in a situation he intends to manipulate.
Jacob agrees to work seven years in exchange for a marriage to Rachel.
Laban tricks Jacob by giving his elder daughter, Leah, in the marriage bed.
Jacob is, understandably, shaken and irate.
However, Jacob does wed Rachel a week later and agrees to a subsequent 7 year contract- which he fulfills.
He has the underrowing of God's Spirit and the reminder of a promise of well-being.
