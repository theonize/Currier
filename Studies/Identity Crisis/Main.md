# Intro

The atheist asks why there is evil in the world.
It's existence surely means there cannot be a God because <reasons here>.
This is actually an easy question to answer (from Genesis 2-3):
the reason there is evil is becauss there is man, and man has dominion in the Earth.

A more pertinent question is why there is good in the world.
There is no physical or mental basis for it.
There is no substrate for the universe that can account for ethical goodness.
Yet we see the effects of good.
As believers we, not denying the war beneath, acknowledge that God's charity improves life on the whole.

We have the same dichotomy in the story of Jacob.
Charles Spurgeon said, "the mystery is not that God hated Esau, but that God loved Jacob."
Jacob was not a "good" guy: he was a schemer and manipulator, perhaps lazy and entitled, certainly selfish and opportunistic.

But God chose him to underrow the future nation of Israel.
God orchestrated the events of His life and blessed him to that end.
So it is with us: God loves us and has pierced the darkness for as many as possible and shaped us to include us in his work.
This creation and re-creation forms our identity.
The struggle with evil in us is our crisis.


# Identity & Crisis

Identity literally means "sameness".
When we talk aboutt our "identity" we are really expressing the perception of our true nature.
We do this by _identifying_ the various things we are the same as.

  For instance: I am a human, the same as other humans;  I am male, the same as other males;  I am American, the same as other Americans.
However, not all humans have ten fingers or two legs.
Regardless of that we perceive (rightly) a _human_ sameness despite the differences that make us distinguishable.
I am male because of my genetic structure.
However, my genetic structure is unique and does not share many properties with other male humans.
Likewise, I am American because I was born in the American territory.
This citizenship is not unqiue and I do not share many other identifying characteristics with other Americans.

  It is not only important to understand what identity is metaphysically but that its discovery elevates and illuminates our purpose.
Whatever it is we were made to do is both constrained by, and enhanced by, our identity.
Put another way- understanding our identity shines light on who we truly are, how we may interact with others, and how we deal with life.

Crisis literally means "turning point".
It was originally a Greek medical term referring to the _turning point_ in a disease.
e.g. that point in a flu where the fever may break...or not.  The patient is on the verge of recovery or death.
A crisis of identity is one that point where we discover something about ourselves that is unsettling.
That unsettled feeling is always a precursor to change, for better or worse.
This is actually a good thing.
There can be no courage with fear.
There can be no accumulation without struggle.


# Nature / Nurture

The story of Jacob reveals many things.
Here we will look at the providential development of his identity, character, and ability.
Regarding the question of whether identity is formed by nature or nurture, the answer is...yes.
We have talents and genes imbued by our creator.
We also have skills and knowledge input by experience.


## Genesis 25

  Jacob is a twin.
In utero he struggled with his brother and a prophecy was given [v.23] that these were two nascent nations and the younger would rule the older.
This fact providentially decided yet the declaration of it shaped Rebekah's attitude toward her sons.
The natural thing is the proclivity of the boys to struggle.
The nurture element is the treatment of the boys.

  Jacob means `usurper`.
Naming a child thus gives him a certain expectation.
They were raised in accordance with the parents expectation.
However, they also had tendencies: Esau was a macho outdoorsman, Jacob was a studious homebody.
Jacob's first usurpation comes when Esau is famished.
Jacob demands Esau's birthright in exchange for food and Esau agrees.
In this we see Jacob's character in action.
He is immature but acting according to who he is and how is being raised.
He is an opportunist, taking advantage of a situation for personal gain.


## Genesis 27

  Mother knows best.
This saying is loaded but we can take it [here] to mean that Rebekah is actively influencing events.
Isaac is expiring and ready to give his formal blessing: a right of survivorship which will pass on the headship of the family.
She intervenes and guides Jacob through a process to trick Isaac into blessing Jacob instead of Esau.
This is a formative experience for Jacob but remember that he is already over 40 years old.
He has been brought up in this way of scheming and plotting but Rebekah is also sacrificial [v.13]; she accepts responsibility as she guides him.

  The siblings are ruptured.
Isaac and Rebekah fear for Jacob's safety and send him away.
This is another formative experience for the man.
He will be gone for decades, living with the nagging estrangement from his twin brother.


## Genesis 28

  Jacob goes into the wilderness.
It is not a conincidence that many have met God in the wilderness.
It is when we are apart from the world and vulnerable that we are open to deepest influence by God.
The vision [v.12] sets the stage for Jacob's further development and includes a promise.
Jacob makes a conditional vow to God.
It does not appear that he is looking for a loophole or an exit strategy.
It is more like Jacob acknowledging that God is God if God does what He says He will do.
For [perhaps] the first time Jacob sees the providential orchestration and formation of his life.
God is moving him and, though Jacob cannot know precisely where or how, preserving him.


## Genesis 29

  Jacob arrives in Haran.
In his first encounter with the locals we see him giving direction but the shepherds correct him.
Then we are introduced the Rachel as Jacob swoons.
This is an interesting interplay of Jacob's natural inclinations butting up against reality.
Here, he is no one's favorite son and what he wants will not be handed to him.

  Jacob meets his match in Haran.
Jacob's uncle Laban has a similar character to Rebekah and Jacob- a schemer...and he has been doing it longer.
He is opportunistic, like Jacob, and strikes a deal in a situation he intends to manipulate.
Jacob agrees to work seven years in exchange for a marriage to Rachel.
Laban tricks Jacob by giving his elder daughter, Leah, in the marriage bed.
Jacob is, understandably, shaken and irate.
However, Jacob does wed Rachel a week later and agrees to a subsequent 7 year contract- which he fulfills.
He has the underrowing of God's Spirit and the reminder of a promise of well-being.
Laban is like a mirror to Jacob: he reveals unsavory parts of his character.
Jacob's nature does not fundamentally change, rather it matures.
These events serve to shape his identity.

  The womb war ensures.
Jacob loves Rachel but Leah bears him children.
It is a strange interplay from modern eyes.
However, the necessity of offspring is fundamental and Jacob understands the importance of them.


## Genesis 30

  Jacob works and works.
Jacob fathers children through his two wives and two slaves.
We know that, during this time, he also worked as a shepherd of Laban's flocks.
It is interesting that Jacob is portrayed as a passive participant in the womb wars- he goes to whichever bed he is directed.
This is a departure from the patriarchal cultural norm: Jacob's women have a higher place in his household than is typical (he learned this from his father and grandfather.)

  Jacob grows.
Jacob communicates to Laban his desire to leave.
Laban balks and they strike a deal where Jacob will receive any discolored livestock from the flock.
Laban promptly removes all discolored livestock and moves them away, attempting to force Jacob to stay.
However, Jacob's flocks bear discolored offspring anyway; he specially waters them to attain this effect.
So, we see the providence propogation of the genes favorable to Jacob.
The effect is so monumental that Jacob becomes rich and his cousins accuse him of, somehow, cheating the system.

At this point we can look back and see how God has shaped Jacob through the years.
Only Providence can change a person's identity.
Only Providence can give talents to a person.
However, we must also recognize that knowledge and skills are developing through life experience.
From these come wisdom and aptitude that allow us to apply our nature to reality.

This is why is it nonsense to say things like, "I am a natural-born leader."
Leadership prowess may, very well, depend on natural charisma, intellect, and speech-quality but involves many other skills which can only be developed over time.
When undeveloped people are thrust into leadership too soon because of their natural abilities they tend to flounder or mis-lead because they lack the wisdom and aptitude necessary for the job.

This is also why it is nonsense to say, "I identify as <something>."
We cannot change our identity simply by stating it.
Our identiy is defined by experience and genetics.
To say "I am a male" is to perceive that my genetics correspond with those defined as male.
To say "I am American" is to perceive that my birthplace is commensurate with those denoting such citizenship.

Without this understanding it is impossible for us to know our identity.
It is a thing to be grasped, not a thing to be placed.
It is a thing that is created, not a thing that we make.
In understanding our identity we see that providence is, indeed, the interplay between the actions of multiple beings: many created, one preeminent.
We can also come to a deeper understanding of what God meant in declaring Hisself "I Am".
God is what He is, we are what fundamentals and activity have made us.


# Genesis 31

  Jacob seeks council.
Upon God's prompting Jacob plans his departure and seeks council from his wives.
Laban's machinations have alienated his daughters.
So, their faith in Jacob has been solidified.
Jacob's leadership ability has culminated in the acquisition of wealth and the building of a strong household (though not without it's flaws.)
Jacob's ultimate separation from Laban, whom he enriched, was capped by worship through an acknowledgment of God as "the Fear of Isaac" and a sacrifice.
This is a stark contrast to his separation from Esau, whom he left enraged and blubbering.


# Genesis 32

  Jacob feared his brother.
This is why he sends messengers ahead with gifts to smooth any ruffled feathers.
He also splits his people to avoid being entrapped.
He also sends them off in groups so there will time for the others to escape if any are attacked.
He recognises, v.10, God's incredible blessing throughout and His promise of prosperity.
However, he still plans pragmatically.
Jacob's scheming personality now enables him to deal shrewdly with events while still moving the direction God wants him to.

  Jacob wrestles with God.
It is notable that Jacob pins the incarnation to demand a blessing.
God has already offered the blessing so Jacob is on strong footing- the word of God- to demand it.
Jacob's identity is literally changed via his new name: Israel (meaning "struggles with God".)
From this point on whenever the man acts in accordance with God he is referred to as Israel, otherwise he is Jacob.


# Genesis 33

  Esau loved Jacob.
Jacob sees Esau approaching and fears him.
Esau hugs and kisses him and they weep together.
Jacob buys a new parcel and names it El-Elohe-Israel: God is the God of Israel.
This hearkens back to his prayer in chapter 28- God has done what He said He would do.
Jacob has created a place, a heritage, that is literally descriptive of the providence he recognizes in his life.


# Genesis 34

  Jacob's daughter is taken.
Jacob does not act on the news but waits until his sons return.
