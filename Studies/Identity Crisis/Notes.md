# Identity Crisis Notes
* What is identity?
  * literally "sameness"
  * metaphysically "our comparison of how we are distinct from (or the same as) others"
    e.g. human, male, macho... or not
* What is crisis?
  * etymology "turning point in a disease"
  * metaphysically: the point where things _will_ change, for better or worse


# Genesis 25,27
## Nature / Nurture

* Nature
  * Jacob is a twin
* Nurture
  * Rebekah favored Jacob
  * Jacob was an inside creature
* Esau's birthright
  * Jacob was opportunistic, taking advantage of Esau's feignt
* Esau's blessing
  * Rebekah was opportunistic, guiding Jacob to deceive Isaac


# Genesis 28-29
## Match Met

* Now for the second term: crisis
  * literally "a turning point" in a disease: could go well...or not
* This is how we learn our identity: life
  * Experience
    * forced out of home
    * in the wilderness
  * Rumination
    * meeting God @ Bethel
    * making a deal (pedantically)
  * Others
    * found among his own: shepherds
    * interacting, advising/commanding
    * deceived by Laban
  * Mysticism
    * chance encounter
    * infatuation
    * Leah's fertility


# Genesis 30-31
## Messiness

* Jacob is depicted as a tool in the womb-war story
* 7+7 years, then time to go
* Herd contest
  * Laban dishonest
  * God gave Jacob an increase
* Becoming the man of God...continually
  * We grow into our identity
  * This is why it is nonsense to say "I am a natural-born ###"
    * Talents (natural abilities) and skills (learned abilities) may enhance that identity but they do not make it
  * This is also why it is nonsense to say "I identify as ###"
    * We are the product of our God-given gifts + life experience
    * Only God can change our identity and he does it through a lifetime of nature + nurture
* Time to go
  * Jacob valued the council of his wives- they were his only allies
  * Laban's treachery alienated Jacob & Leah & Rachel


## Genesis 32-33
### The Duality

* Saved and saving
* Ideal / Surreal
* Jacob / Israel




## Genesis 34-35, 42
### What good is my identity?

* Truth ~ Testimony
* Righteousness ~ Ethics & Morality
* Salvation ~ Destiny
* Evangel ~ Preparation
* Faith ~ Belief
* 






## Genesis 45-48
### Legacy

* New land
* Crossed hands
* Hebrews 11:21
