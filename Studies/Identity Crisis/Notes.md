# Introduction
* Overview of Jacob's life, no nitty-gritty
* Atheist asks about evil, should ask about good
* Spurgeon: Esau hated+, Jacob loved-


# Identity Crisis Notes
* What is identity?
  * literally "sameness"
  * metaphysically "we understand our uniqueness by discerning different way we are like others"
    * e.g. human, male, macho... or not
    * Mead: You're unique, just like everyone else.
* What is crisis?
  * etymology "turning point in a disease"
    * i.e. the fever breaks- or not
  * metaphysically: the point where things _will_ change, for better or worse
    * i.e. the wilderness experience


# Genesis 25,27
## Nature / Nurture

1. Jacob is a twin
2. Rebekah favored Jacob
3. Jacob was an inside creature
4. Esau's birthright
   - Jacob was opportunistic, taking advantage of Esau's feignt
5. Esau's blessing
   - Rebekah was opportunistic, guiding Jacob to deceive Isaac

para

1. Nature
   - two nations
   - came out heel-grabbing (usurper)
2. Nurture
   - favored by mom
   - told about the prophecy
3. Proclivities, natural bent

# Genesis 28-29
## Match Met

1. Exiled
   * in the wilderness
   * meeting God @ Bethel
2. Making a deal (pedantically)
3. Found among his own: shepherds
   * interacting, advising/commanding
   * chance encounter
   * infatuation
4. Deceived by Laban
   * Leah's fertility
   * 2 wives + 7-year contract

para

1. Crisis
2. Response to crisis: brokering with God
   * you cannot change your mind by changing your thoughts
   * changing your mind == change your location, posture, words
3. Learning identity
   * no chance, every chance w/ Theosis
   * 4 ways to find our identity
   - 1) Experience; interactions
   - 2) Rumination; work, watching
4. Mirroring identity
   - 3) Others; their behavior / ours
   - 4) Mysticism; chance, infatuation, fertility


# Genesis 30-31
## Messiness

1. Womb-war
   * 12 sons, 1 daughter
   * 2 wives, 2 slaves
2. 7+7 years; time to go
3. Herd contest agreement
   * Laban dishonest
   * Goat tea, God increased Jacob's here
4. Time to go
   * Jacob's wife council- his only allies
   * Laban alienated those 3
   * Laban/Joseph treaty, Fear of Isaac

para

1. Jacob is used
   * not culturally outlandish; he & his wives ambition
   * willing to be used
   * willing to work
2. Continually becoming, over a decade
3. Providence, obviously
4. God's long-term plan shaping Jacob & family
   * We grow into our identity
   * Nonsense == "I'm a natural-born ???"
     * Talents (natural abilities) and skills (learned abilities) may enhance identity but do not make it
   * Nonsense == "I identify as ###"
     * We are God-given gifts + life experience
     * God alone changes identity: lifetime of nature + nurture


## Genesis 32-33
### The Duality

1. Sending messengers, fear
2. Splitting the group, fear

   * demands the promise
   * renamed Israel
5. Brotherly kiss
6. El-Elhoe-Israel

para

1. Diplomacy
2. Pragmatism
3. Shrewdness FTW
   * Remembering Providence
   * Scheming benefit for others
4. He literally holds the promise, Face of God
   * literally holding the Word
   * Israel ~ wrestles with God
     * from now on: Jacob/Israel situationally
5. Esau is providentially prepared [as well]
6. God is the God of Israel
   * fulfillment of the prayer/promise
   * exposit of his life
