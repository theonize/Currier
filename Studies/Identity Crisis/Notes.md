# Introduction
* Overview of Jacob's life, no nitty-gritty
* Atheist asks about evil, should ask about good
* Spurgeon: Esau hated+, Jacob loved-


# Identity Crisis Notes
* What is identity?
  * literally "sameness"
  * metaphysically "we understand our uniqueness by discerning different way we are like others"
    e.g. human, male, macho... or not
    Mead: You're unique, just like everyone else.
* What is crisis?
  * etymology "turning point in a disease"
    * i.e. the fever breaks- or not
  * metaphysically: the point where things _will_ change, for better or worse
    * i.e. the wilderness experience


# Genesis 25,27
## Nature / Nurture

1. Jacob is a twin
2. Rebekah favored Jacob
3. Jacob was an inside creature
4. Esau's birthright
  * Jacob was opportunistic, taking advantage of Esau's feignt
5. Esau's blessing
  * Rebekah was opportunistic, guiding Jacob to deceive Isaac

1. Nature
  * two nations
  * came out heel-grabbing (usurper)
2. Nurture
  * favored by mom
  * told about the prophecy
3. Proclivities, natural bent
4. Jacob's opportunism ~ shrewdness & character 
5. Rebekah's opportunism ~ O.G.


# Genesis 28-29
## Match Met

1. Exiled
  * in the wilderness
  * meeting God @ Bethel
2. Taking a deal (pedantically)
3. found among his own: shepherds
  * interacting, advising/commanding
  * chance encounter
   * no chance, every chance w/ Theosis
  * infatuation
4. deceived by Laban
  * Leah's fertility
  * 2 wives + 7-year contract

1. Crisis
2. Response to crisis: brokering with God
3. Learning identity
  * Experience; interactions
  * Rumination; work, watching
4. Mirroring identity
  * Others; their behavior / ours
  * Mysticism; chance, infatuation, fertility


# Genesis 30-31
## Messiness

1. Womb-war
  * 12 sons, 1 daughter
  * 2 wives, 2 slaves
2. 7+7 years; time to go
3. Herd contest agreement
  * Laban dishonest
  * God increased Jacob anyway
4. Time to go
  * Jacob's wife council- his only allies
  * Laban alienated those 3

1. Jacob is used
  * not culturally outlandish; he & his wives ambition
  * willing to be used
  * willing to work
2. Continually becoming, over a decade
3. Providence, obviously
4. God's long-term plan shaping Jacob & family
  * We grow into our identity
  * Nonsense == "I'm a natural-born ???"
    * Talents (natural abilities) and skills (learned abilities) may enhance identity but do not make it
  * Nonsense == "I identify as ###"
    * We are God-given gifts + life experience
    * God alone changes identity: lifetime of nature + nurture


## Genesis 32-33
### The Duality

1. Sending messengers
2. Splitting the group
3. Recognition
  * recounting God's blessings
  * decisive, nuanced actions

  * renamed Israel
5. Brotherly kiss
6. El-Elhoe-Israel

1. Diplomacy
2. Pragmatism
3. Shrewdness FTW
  * Remembering Providence
  * Scheming benefit for others
4. He literally holds the promise
  * literally holding the Word
  * Israel ~ wrestles with God
    * from now on: Jacob/Israel situationally
5. Esau is providentially prepared [as well]
6. God is the God of Israel
  * fulfillment of the prayer/promise
  * exposit of his life


## Genesis 34-35, 42

    * Jacob not manipulated


## Why my identity?

* We want to look back, at the end, and see the Providence
  * Providence is the belief that all of history has been orchestrated to bring you into the presence of God at this very moment- and that every human can claim this.

* Belt of Truth ~ You are God's testimony
* Breastplate of Righteousness ~ knowing what is right (ethics) & doing what is right (morality)
* Shoes of Evangel ~ being prepared with the message
* Shield of Faith ~ belief that God will stand before you
* Helmet of Salvation ~ understanding and striving for hope of a destiny
* Sword of Spirit ~ incarnate power of God
