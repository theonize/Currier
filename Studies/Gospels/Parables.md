## Healing the Paralytic

### Mark 2:1-12, Matthew 9:1-8, Luke 5:17-26
  A man's friends lower him through the ceiling to get at Jesus.
  He wants to be healed.
  Jesus forgives his sins
  - we cannot _see_ sin, not its release
  Jesus heals him as proof of his authority to forgive sin
  - He does the knowable, shows the seeable to prove His authority to do the unknowable, the unseeable
