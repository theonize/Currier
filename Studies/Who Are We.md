# Who Are We?


## Ephesians 6

The armor of God...recap.
* 1 Thessalonians 5:8 ~ The armor of faith & love

**Belt of Truth**
* Binds the waist/gut
* Indicates the will

**Shoes of Evangel**
* Protects/enhances the feet for travel
* Indicates the system of belief making us ready

**Shield of Faith**
* Protects the body in whole
* Indicates the capability of our whole being to be grounded

**Helmet of salvation**
* Covers the head/brain
* Indicates the mind/pysche & the soul (that which is saved)

**Sword of the Spirit**
* The only offensive tool
* Indicates knowledge and wisdom

## Matthew 5

Comes near the start of Jesus' public ministry.
He withdraws from the crowds and goes up, with his disciples, in seclusion.
"up on the mountain" is somewhat unusual for an ancient person; most mountains are not readily accessible without significant technology and they were considered the abode of the gods.

The fact that he _opened his mouth_ to teach them implies a personal, physical Christ connection.


Each line of this poem contains a demographic descriptor and a resultant condition.
It is left to the reader to fill in the blank: what causes that type of person to achieve the mentioned status?

|vs|Who|What|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|3|Poor in Spirit|Spiritual deficiency|Ownership in the Kingdom|
|4|Mourners|Experience loss|Comfort|
|5|Meek|Strength under control|Inheritance in general|
|6|Hungry & Thirsty|Experience injustice|Satisfacation of justice|
|7|Merciful|Have been wronged|Mercy for their wrongs|
|8|Pure|Redeemed people|Theosis, present with God|
|9|Peacemakers|Experience aggression|Known to belong to God|
|10|Martyrs|Stout witness|Ownership in the Kingdom|


### Ruminations:
* How would acknowledgement of our lack (shortcomings, depravity) shape our development?
* What is meekness?  How does affect our dealings with other people?
* Why might hardships produce excellent character?  When would they not?
* What is the balance between justice and mercy and grace in God's economy?
* What is spiritual purity in God's eyes?  Why is it so bloody?
* If meekness, purity, mercy, etc. are hallmarks of God's people, can non-believers truly portray these traits?
* Why does He begin and end with "theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven"


### Concepts:
* Acknowledgment of deficiency and depravity are prerequisites for blessing
* The path of humility, mercy, and grace yield more strength than the path that claims power
* Loss and oppression are not overlooked, or forgotten, by God
* God's plan involves eventually being present with us
