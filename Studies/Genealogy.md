# Genealogies

[1Chr 6:3+]()
  vs.
[Ezra 7:1+]()

These are interesting because both go from Levi to Seraiah
...but Ezra leaves out some generations

This is not a proof of gaps within genealogies.
Jesus' genealogies appear to have a consistency of ~50yr per generation which gives 1250yr which is roughly congruent with the time-span from the conquest to the incarnation.
However, the gaps in Ezra's genealogy does allow us the freedom to reconcile more ancient dates.
- e.g. Babel ~ the manpower required to build the tower was more than could have been bred within 3 generations
- e.g. Egyptian captivity ~ the size of the Hebrew nation was far more than 400yr worth of generations; this, coupled with consistent Biblical numerology of 4/40/400, allows us interpretive freedom in fitting this time-period to archaelogical fact
