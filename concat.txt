Genesis 48:15+
	“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,
16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys;
and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
and let them grow into a multitude[fn] in the midst of the earth.”

Exodus 15:1-3,11-12
	“I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously;
the horse and his rider[fn] he has thrown into the sea.
 The LORD is my strength and my song,
and he has become my salvation;
this is my God, and I will praise him,
my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
 The LORD is a man of war;
the LORD is his name.
	“Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods?
Who is like you, majestic in holiness,
awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
 You stretched out your right hand;
the earth swallowed them.

Leviticus 19:2-4,
	“Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. 3 Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. 4 Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves any gods of cast metal: I am the LORD your God.

Numbers 6:24+
	The LORD bless you and keep you;
	The LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
	The LORD lift up his countenance[fn] upon you and give you peace.
 	“So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.”

Deuteronomy 32:4-9
	“The Rock, his work is perfect,
for all his ways are justice.
A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,
just and upright is he.
5 They have dealt corruptly with him;
they are no longer his children because they are blemished;
they are a crooked and twisted generation.
6 Do you thus repay the LORD,
you foolish and senseless people?
Is not he your father, who created you,
who made you and established you?
7 Remember the days of old;
consider the years of many generations;
ask your father, and he will show you,
your elders, and they will tell you.
8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
when he divided mankind,
he fixed the borders[fn] of the peoples
according to the number of the sons of God.[fn]
9 But the LORD’s portion is his people,
Jacob his allotted heritage.

Joshua 24:14-15
	“Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. 15 And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”

Judges 5:2-5
	“That the leaders took the lead in Israel,
that the people offered themselves willingly,
bless the LORD!
	“Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes;
to the LORD I will sing;
I will make melody to the LORD, the God of Israel.
 	“LORD, when you went out from Seir,
when you marched from the region of Edom,
the earth trembled
and the heavens dropped,
yes, the clouds dropped water.
	The mountains quaked before the LORD,
even Sinai before the LORD, the God of Israel.

Ruth 1:16-17,19
	“Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. 17 Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.”
	So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem.

1 Samuel 2:1-8
	“My heart exults in the LORD;
my horn is exalted in the LORD.
My mouth derides my enemies,
because I rejoice in your salvation.
	“There is none holy like the LORD:
for there is none besides you;
there is no rock like our God.
	Talk no more so very proudly,
let not arrogance come from your mouth;
for the LORD is a God of knowledge,
and by him actions are weighed.
	The bows of the mighty are broken,
but the feeble bind on strength.
	Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,
but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.
The barren has borne seven,
but she who has many children is forlorn.
	The LORD kills and brings to life;
he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
	The LORD makes poor and makes rich;
he brings low and he exalts.
	He raises up the poor from the dust;
he lifts the needy from the ash heap
to make them sit with princes
and inherit a seat of honor.
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s,
and on them he has set the world.

2 Samuel 22:2-7
	“The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
my[fn] God, my rock, in whom I take refuge,
my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
my stronghold and my refuge,
my savior; you save me from violence.
	I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised,
and I am saved from my enemies.
	“For the waves of death encompassed me,
the torrents of destruction assailed me;[fn]
	the cords of Sheol entangled me;
the snares of death confronted me.
	“In my distress I called upon the LORD;
to my God I called.
From his temple he heard my voice,
and my cry came to his ears.

1 Kings 8:27-30
	“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!  Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day,  that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.  And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.

2 Kings 19: 15-19
	“O LORD, the God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. 16 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of _Sins-Many-Brothers_, which he has sent to mock the living God.  Truly, O LORD, the kings of _Their-Own-Wisdom_ have laid waste the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.  So now, O LORD our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O LORD, are God alone.”

1 Chronicles 16:8-18
	Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name;
make known his deeds among the peoples!
	Sing to him, sing praises to him;
tell of all his wondrous works!
	Glory in his holy name;
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!
	Seek the LORD and his strength;
seek his presence continually!
	Remember the wondrous works that he has done,
his miracles and the judgments he uttered,
	O offspring of Israel his servant,
children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
	He is the LORD our God;
his judgments are in all the earth.
	Remember his covenant forever,
the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
	the covenant that he made with Abraham,
his sworn promise to Isaac,
	which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
	saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
as your portion for an inheritance.”

2 Chronicles 20:6-9
	 “O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.  Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?  And they have lived in it and have built for you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying, ‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment,[fn] or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before you—for your name is in this house—and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’

Ezra 9:6-9
	“O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens.  From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as it is today.  But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a secure hold[fn] within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery.  For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love

Nehemiah 9:6,32,31
	“You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.
	“Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. 33 Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly.
	Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.

Job 42:2-6
	“I know that you can do all things,
and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
	‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,
things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
	‘Hear, and I will speak;
I will question you, and you make it known to me.’
	I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
but now my eye sees you;  therefore I despise myself,
and repent[fn] in dust and ashes.”

Psalm 51
	Have mercy on me,[fn] O God,
according to your steadfast love;
according to your abundant mercy
blot out my transgressions.
	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
and cleanse me from my sin!
 
	For I know my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me.
	Against you, you only, have I sinned
and done what is evil in your sight,
so that you may be justified in your words
and blameless in your judgment.
	Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
and in sin did my mother conceive me.
	Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,
and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.
 
	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
	Let me hear joy and gladness;
let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
	Hide your face from my sins,
and blot out all my iniquities.
	Create in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right[fn] spirit within me.
	Cast me not away from your presence,
and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
	Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
and uphold me with a willing spirit.

Proverbs 2:6-15
	the LORD gives wisdom;
from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
	he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
	guarding the paths of justice
and watching over the way of his saints.
	Then you will understand righteousness and justice
and equity, every good path;
	for wisdom will come into your heart,
and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
	discretion will watch over you,
understanding will guard you,
	delivering you from the way of evil,
from men of perverted speech,
	who forsake the paths of uprightness
to walk in the ways of darkness,
	who rejoice in doing evil
and delight in the perverseness of evil,
	men whose paths are crooked,
and who are devious in their ways.

Ecclesiastes 7:14-18
	God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.  In my vain[fn] life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.  Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?  Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?  It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.

Song of Songs 2:4,8-10
	He brought me to the banqueting house,[fn]
and his banner over me was love.
	The voice of my beloved!
Behold, he comes, leaping over the mountains,
bounding over the hills.
	My beloved is like a gazelle
or a young stag.
	Behold, there he stands
behind our wall, gazing through the windows, looking through the lattice.
	My beloved speaks and says to me: “Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away,

Isaiah 53:1-6
	Who has believed what he has heard from us?[fn]
And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
	For he grew up before him like a young plant,
and like a root out of dry ground;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,
and no beauty that we should desire him.
	He was despised and rejected[fn] by men;
a man of sorrows,[fn] and acquainted with[fn] grief;[fn]
and as one from whom men hide their faces[fn]
he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
 
	Surely he has borne our griefs
and carried our sorrows;
yet we esteemed him stricken,
smitten by God, and afflicted.
	But he was pierced for our transgressions;
he was crushed for our iniquities;
upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
and with his wounds we are healed.
	All we like sheep have gone astray;
we have turned—every one—to his own way;
and the LORD has laid on him
the iniquity of us all.

Isaiah 49:13-16
	Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth;
break forth, O mountains, into singing!
For the LORD has comforted his people
and will have compassion on his afflicted.
	But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me;
my Lord has forgotten me.”
 	“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
Even these may forget,
yet I will not forget you.
16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
your walls are continually before me.

Jeremiah 31:33-34
	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”

Malachi 3:17+
	“They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in the day when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. 18 Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.

Matthew 13:24Any political hack can sell his soul to get ahead;  A truly skilled politician can gain on the sale of the souls of others.


God puts maggots in our lives to clean the wounds.


The desire for preeminence is the death knell of usefulness.

	men whose paths are crooked,

Ecclesiastes 7:14-18
	God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.  In my vain[fn] life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.  Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?  Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?  It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.

Song of Songs 2:4,8-10
	He brought me to the banqueting house,[fn]
and his banner over me was love.
	The voice of my beloved!
Behold, he comes, leaping over the mountains,
bounding over the hills.
	My beloved is like a gazelle
or a young stag.
	Behold, there he stands
behind our wall, gazing through the windows, looking through the lattice.
	My beloved speaks and says to me: “Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away,

Isaiah 53:1-6
	Who has believed what he has heard from us?[fn]
And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
	For he grew up before him like a young plant,
and like a root out of dry ground;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,
and no beauty that we should desire him.
	He was despised and rejected[fn] by men;
a man of sorrows,[fn] and acquainted with[fn] grief;[fn]
and as one from whom men hide their faces[fn]
he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
 
	Surely he has borne our griefs
and carried our sorrows;
yet we esteemed him stricken,
smitten by God, and afflicted.
	But he was pierced for our transgressions;
he was crushed for our iniquities;
upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
and with his wounds we are healed.
	All we like sheep have gone astray;
we have turned—every one—to his own way;
and the LORD has laid on him
the iniquity of us all.

Isaiah 49:13-16
	Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth;
break forth, O mountains, into singing!
For the LORD has comforted his people
and will have compassion on his afflicted.
	But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me;
my Lord has forgotten me.”
 	“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
Even these may forget,
yet I will not forget you.
16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
your walls are continually before me.

Jeremiah 31:33-34
	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”

Malachi 3:17+
	“They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in the day when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. 18 Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.

Truly, O LORD, the kings of _Their-Own-Wisdom_ have laid waste the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.  So now, O LORD our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O LORD, are God alone.”

2 Chronicles 20:6-9

Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?  And they have lived in it and have built for you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying, ‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment,[fn] or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before you—for your name is in this house—and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’

Ezra 9:6-9
	“O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens.  From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as it is today.  But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a secure hold[fn] within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery.  For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love

Nehemiah 9:6,32,31
	“You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.
	“Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. 33 Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly.
	Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.

Job 42:2-6
	“I know that you can do all things,
and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
	‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,
things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
	‘Hear, and I will speak;
I will question you, and you make it known to me.’
	I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
but now my eye sees you;  therefore I despise myself,
and repent[fn] in dust and ashes.”

Psalm 51
	Have mercy on me,[fn] O God,
according to your steadfast love;
according to your abundant mercy
blot out my transgressions.
	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
and cleanse me from my sin!
 
	For I know my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me.
	Against you, you only, have I sinned
and done what is evil in your sight,
so that you may be justified in your words
and blameless in your judgment.
	Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
and in sin did my mother conceive me.
	Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,
and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.
 
	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
	Let me hear joy and gladness;
let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
	Hide your face from my sins,
and blot out all my iniquities.
	Create in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right[fn] spirit within me.
	Cast me not away from your presence,
and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
	Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
and uphold me with a willing spirit.

Proverbs 2:6-15
	the LORD gives wisdom;
from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
	he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
	guarding the paths of justice
and watching over the way of his saints.
	Then you will understand righteousness and justice
and equity, every good path;
	for wisdom will come into your heart,
and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
	discretion will watch over you,
understanding will guard you,
	delivering you from the way of evil,
from men of perverted speech,
	who forsake the paths of uprightness
to walk in the ways of darkness,
	who rejoice in doing evil
and delight in the perverseness of evil,
	men whose paths are crooked,
and who are devious in their ways.

## What is it?

  There are many patterns in Scripture.
If these patterns are divinely inspired then they will be approachable and digestable inasmuch as God wants them to be.
This method involves four ways of gleaning this information:
* Historical
* Literary
* Lexical
* Theological
  
These approaches can be applied to the book as a whole, to passages, or to topics.
More on this method in [How to Study Your Bible](/Studies/How%20to%20Study%20Your%20Bible/index.md)
  
  There are various notes and studies that attempt to do this- 
hopefully the format is easily digestable and will motivate people to pursue God.
Apologies for the earlier stuff that is a journaled and scattered.

**I believe in a personal God, the God of the Bible.  
I believe that He speaks through His Word to us and the most salient points are revealed to us by His Spirit.  
I believe that it is okay if there are things about Him that we don't fully understand but the essential things are knowable by all.  
I believe that He is holy, good, and just: but also, thankfully, merciful and gracious; but we cannot fully know any of these things.  
I believe that we cannot stand in His presence in our natural state and that is a purposeful dilemma designed to draw us to ask, "Why?"**Markup

~ diabolos

"the accuser"
opposing counsel
the calumniator


## Purpose

Originally, to participate in the rulership of creation

Now, to bring blame/accusation against people

These divine actors are not, necessarily, evil and opposed to Yahweh;  the act of accusation is not rebellious.


## Personage

It is not explicit [in the bible] that the various incarnations of devil's are a certain individual.
There are a couple references to a particular creature.

	[2Sam 12]
	[Rom 7]
		when was he not under the law?
	[Num ?]
		age 20 (ish) for priests

See [Innocence]
	Accountability coincides with the persuasion of guilt.
Advancement

[Dan 12:4] ~ knowledge shall continually increase

Even today we see an increase in knowledge about everything, including Scripture.
Discoveries compound as new experts arise who bridge the gap between specialties.

[1Cor 13] ~ knowledge shall pass away

## Classic

Planned by God
Performed by God

Required Incarnation
Works with justification & sanctification
Committment

"The chicken who provided the egg was involved; the pig who provided the ham was committed."
Competency


Competency cannot be determined within oneself, it is determined by the teacher.  In our case, this is Scripture.

Elements leading to Scriptural competency:
	consistent interpretation
	literal interpretation
	accountability to doctrine
	symbols and numbers are explained elsewhere in Scripture

Doctrine = an advocated position
	our advocate is Christ
	our position is Truth

Each covenant advances the previous without abrogating it


[Rom 9:4]
[Gal 3:16]


Abraham the father of many nations
Peter/Paul write the the church and Israel as one
	"the seed"
Esther ~ they became Jews

Discipleship

Training
...competence
...character
...community
...calling


A brief start:

Titus 2:4 — Older women are to train younger women

2 Timothy 2:2 — Paul trained Timothy to train others to train others

Ephesians 6:4 — Fathers are to train their children

Matthew 28:20 — Missionaries are to teach the nations everything Jesus commanded

Hebrews 3:13 — All Christians are to exhort each other every day to avoid sin and to stir each other up to love and good works (see also Hebrews 10:24–25)

First Peter 4:10 — All Christians are to use their gifts to serve others

Acts 18:24–26 — Priscilla and Aquila, on the spur of the moment it seems, explained the way of God more accurately to Apollos
Divine Dispensations


Two Sides:
	Covenantal Theology
	Dispensationalism

	unfortunately, these two terms are not descriptive of the two points of view (at least not of their important aspects)


commonalities w/ "non-dispensationalists"
	unified plan of salvation
	unified people of God
		[1Pet 1:1-2]
		[1Pet 2:9-10]
	current aspect of the kingdom of God
		[Rom 14:17]
	single basis of salvation
	    [Eph 2:8-9]
		grace alone through faith alone
	spiritual seed of Abraham
	    [Gal 3:16]


primary sticking points:
	normal, plain, consistent hermeneutic
	glory of God as the unifying theme of all Scripture and history
		1. program of redemption
		2. program for Israel
		3. punishment of the wicked
		4. plan for angels
		5. nature
	distinction between Israel and Church
	literal Israel
	literal kingdom
	literal trib
	literal rapture

Cov's vs. Dispy's
	cov's tend to treat Scripture allegorically
	dispy's tend to take Scripture literally

	cov's tend toward replacement theology (of varying degrees)
	dispy's tend toward literal Israel (and the distinction of genetic Jews)

	cov's tend toward amillenial eschatology (or other similar views like post-trib)
	dispy's tend toward pre-millenial, and mostly pre-trib
		mid-trib is defensible for a dispy but becomes tricky


Dispensation
	?dispensing of what?
	~ a period of time bracketed by covenants
	more of an economic term: production, distribution, and consumption
	~ man is tested, in respect of obedience, according to the current revelation of God
	= household management is implied

Covenant
	Fiduciary arrangement (suzerainty)
		suzerain (delegator)
			a sovereign having control over another state that is internally autonomous
		specific responsibilities
		accountabiilty
			repercussions
		specific instantiation
			[Eph 3:2]
			[Col 1:25-26]


The Issue of Scripture
	The Revelation in regards to Dispy
		- divinely deposited
		- human stewardship (fiduciary)
		- chronological and progressive


The Issue of Israel and the Church (and Jews)
	this doctrine is _heavily_ dependent on our hermeneutic
	Israel foremost [Ps 147:19-20]
	Church (invisible)
		the Church is pre-eminent [Eph 1:22-23]
		the צחק/Εκλεσσια is eternal (from/to) [Deut 4:10] [Acts 7:38]
		membership via Spirit baptism [1Jn 2:27]
			[Heb 12:23] [2Tim 2:19]
		*ecclesiastical interval between Daniels 69th & 70th weeks
	church (visible)
		the Body as perceived by 'true believers' [1Cor 1:2] [1Thess 1:1] [Phm 1-2]


The Issue of End Times


Dispensations
	1) Innocence ~ Gen 1:28 - 3:8
	2) Conscience ~ Gen 3:9 - 8:14
	3) Civil Government ~ Gen 8:15 - 11:32
	4) Patriarchy ~ Gen 12:1 - Ex 18:27
	5) Torah ~ Ex 19:1 - Acts 1:26
	*6) Fulfillment ~ Acts 2:1 - Rev 19:21
	7) Kingdom ~ Rev 19:21 +


promises
	"fulfill my covenant"
	"government on His shoulders"
	Jer 30
	Ez 37

	Israel received the promised curses
		how could they not receive the blessings?
		must have a consistent hermeneutic

Church <> Israel

= house rules
	

1) Innocence ~ Gen 1:28 - 3:8
2) Conscience ~ Gen 3:9 - 8:14
3) Civil Government ~ Gen 8:15 - 11:32
4) Patriarchy ~ Gen 12:1 - Ex 18:27
5) Law ~ Ex 19:1 - Acts 1:26
*6) Grace ~ Acts 2:1 - Rev 19:21
7) Kingdom ~ Rev 19:21 +
Doctrine
 = a belief


By way of example:
	[Bibliology] is a belief system regarding the Bible: its nature, origins, and exomation.  There are subordinate doctrines to [Bibliology] and it is subordinate to an entire doctrinal system.  There are different paradigms of [Bibliology] but the notion of it is universal - we all have a belief regarding the Bible.

So, some tenets of a doctrine:
	1. It is exposable (able to be revealed)
	2. It is epistemological (has some truth claim)
	3. It is not atomic (a sememe is ammoral whereas doctrine makes implications)
	4. It is not tangible

	Sememes and items are [Patterns].

		historical
		figures of speech (simile/metaphor)
		prophetic

	Application
		[2Chr 11:13-15]
		'Israel' ~ chosen of God

	Mystical
		e.g. Ark ~ delivery vessel (of His testimony)
			[Gen 6] - delivering His people (and supporting cast)
			[Ex 25:10,21] - "an ark", a model of the Ark
			[Rev 11:19] - "the ark", the original

			ELSs (tread lightlier)

	Allegorical

		[Rev 4]

			?Vs.?

Da Rulz
	The Golden Rule
		= WHEN THE PLAIN SENSE OF SCRIPTURE MAKES COMMON SENSE; MAKE NO OTHER SENSE.
			traditionalists say SEEK no other sense, there is not harm in seeking as long as we
				A) honor the Word
				B) take the plain meaning as primary
		primary ~= literal ~= ordinary
			'secondary' importance is implied for other levels of interpretation
			the Bible is a plain book for common mortals
		rationalism
	Symbolism
		hidden meanings are always exposited elsewhere in the Scripture
			searching is always rewarding
			prospect, don't speculate
				In mining prospecting means digging where you are, speculating means getting new plots to dig in.
	Multiple Reference
		a Scriptural passage may blend disconnected events/people
		Rev 2-3 ~ the churches, church ages, and personal phases
		[Is 14:4,12-17]
			King of Babylon && Lucifer
			[Rev 12:4,9]
		[Is 11:1-5]
			branch = רצנ
			Nazareth = Ναζαρα
	Recurrence
		important ideas are scattered throughout (spread spectrum :)
		multiple passages detailing a single event
		Gen 1:1-2:3, 2:4-25
		Ezk 38:1-23, 39:1-16
		Rev 6-16, 17|18
		NOT?
			[Matt 24:3] [Mark 13:3]
			[Luke 21:5]
	Context
		~ a text apart from it's context is a pretext
		context = preceding and/or following text
		pretext = text(s) imported for an ostensible reason
		beware the eisigesis
		you _cannot_ prove anything by the Bible
		[Zech 13:6]
			the greater passage speaks of false teachers!
	Expositional Constancy
		= idioms and ideals are consistent throughout
		the Holy Spirit will use the same idioms over and over via different authors and different forms of speech
		the number of recurrances of an idea is important
		e.g. Acacia
			"thorn bush of the desert"
			crown of thorns
			material of Ark
				covered w/ gold (glory)
			burning bush (likely)
				fire = judgment
		e.g. Wine
		e.g. Shoes
			don't wear out in desert
			Boaz [Ruth] takes shoe
				title deed
				marriage license
			Jebusite's tattered shoes
			John B's sandals
	First Mention
		= the first mention of a thing has special significance
		'things' often develop from simple to complex (or vice versa)
		idealogical coloring
		! interesting but, what order do you put the books in?
		valid: [Gen 3:22] -> [Rev 22] tree of life
		invalid: most things not mentioned in Pentateuch
	The Stereo Law
		an identical mention of a thing in another context has special significance
		e.g. quotations from the Septuagint
			{Septuagint}
		e.g. "Nazarene" passages
			{Nazarene}
	Cardinality
		the order in which items appear in a list are important
		I'm not prepared to comment on the order in which things appear between the Bible books because they are typically in neither chronological nor their original order (the order is not inspired)
	Dichotomies
		hetero-?
		many Biblical ideas are forehead-slappers
			many of these involve an understanding of time/space that we cannot have
		election vs. calling
		trinity
	Structural Integrity
		the Bible pre-answers [divisive] heresies before they are invented
		John 1:1
		John 12 ()
	Remez Principle (a hint of something deeper)
		[Matt 16:5-12]
			Do ye not _yet_ understand

		[Rev 19:9-10]

		[Ps 119:2,10] - the benefits of seeking


		[Matt 21:15-16]
			A) by saying 'hosanna' the people implied Jesus to be the Savior
			B) when Jesus quotes [Ps 8:2] he [partially] implies that the Pharisees are enemies of God
			Jesus quotes [Ps 8:2] in response to their indignation, but He leaves out the 2nd part of the verse "to still the enemy" - the Pharisees were very likely to have picked up on this
		[Gen 22:9]
			It says Abraham and Isaac went up, but it doesn't _say_ that Isaac came down - Isaac doesn't appear again until he is with his bride [Gen 24:62+]
		[Acts 7]
			Israel blew it, made it up, blew it, made it up, blew it...then Stephen is cut off - what's due next?!
		[Luke 4:18-19]	
			Jesus quotes [Is 61:1-2a] but stops mid-sentence.  The rest of the sentence is: "and the day of vengeance of our God"
		Cities of Refuge
			[Num 35]

טפלמ - prayer


[Rom 8:26-28]

prepare
	Lev ~ sacrifices were arranged beforehand
during
	take notes

[Matt 6][Luke 11]
  Lord's prayer

[John 17]
  High priestly prayer

prerequisites for prayer
  sincerity
  reverence
  obedience [Heb]
    enlightened submission
  God's characteristics
    omniscience
    omnipresent

means
  Father ~ to
  Son ~ through
  Spirit ~ via, παρακλετε

content

consequences
  proximity
  imputation
  sanctification

hindrances

## Words

proseuche ~ prayer, oratory

deisis ~ privation/penury; a sense of the lack of some essential thing [PHP 1:4]
... an interesting correlary is syneidesis ~ conscience, as in the disposition of one's loyalty [1Pet 3:21]

enteuxsis ~ intercession (interview, conference, conversation)

euche ~ vow

euchomai ~ pray, wish


## Points

meditation bridges the gap between prayer and study

the father invites you to pray

Jesus represents you as you pray

the spirit helps you to pray


Preaching

= the art of talking in someone else's sleep

Predestination


God can see all possible outcomes.

Foreknowledge does not induce predestination.

{1 Sam 23}

Prophecy

prophecy is pattern
patterns have two elements
  1. Kernel
  2. Algorithm
  ...the kernel is some core thing that is replicated; the replication is done according to some algorithm.
  e.g. a crystal has a minimal, indivisible unit; in a primed environment it will replicate in a certain way
  i.e. patterns are identifiable in the whole and in parts


[Acts 17:11]
[1Jon 2:27]
[Matt 6:6]
Puns & Multiple Interpretation


[Num 12:6]
	all prophets but Moses received λογος in a dream


God has both a conditional and an unconditional will
- His unconditional will is incontrovertible and immutable
- His conditional will waits on us - or whatever else He may want
e.g. prayer: God may respond to prayer because He desires our involvement


Multiple Fulfillment
e.g. the abomination of desolation in Daniel meshes well with Antiochus Epiphanes actions during the Maccabean Era but...it is a not perfect Fulfillment - that part it yet to come.


Partial Fulfillment
- Already but Not Yet
- there are plenty of instances where prophecies are partly fulfilled
~ a close cousin of this is scripture that partly applies to us
	e.g. OT references to God's children may be about Israel but point to greater truths that apply to us.


Puns
- this is a term that has a double meaning
Purgatory

Eph 4:8-10

1 Peter 3:19-20

	Zechariah 9:11

	#Rapture


rapturo ~ Latin
harpazo ~ Greek
snatch ~ English


[1Th 4:13-17]

[1Cor 15:]

Acts 23:10 - harpazo

Rev 13:6
	blaspheme angels/those in heaven

Joel 2:15-16
	blow Jubel (trumpet/horn)
	"her room"

Isaiah 26:19
	dead men live
	together with...
	they arise
	dwell in the dust
	earth cast out her dead

	come, enter thy chambers...shut thy doors about thee
	a little moment (til indignation is past)

John 14:2
	preparing chambers


Rev 4


[Gen 19]
	Lot's rescue as a type of the rapture
	the angels state that Lot's rescue is a necessary pre-requisite to the coming judgment


[Is 26:19-20]
	dead men live
	...with my dead body
	   (awake and sing)
	...earth casts out the dead
	...come and enter thy chambers, shut thy doors, hide thyselves until the indignation is passed
	? does this refer to the pre-trib system of eschatology?
		i.e. believers raptured to heaven, then return after the tribulation

[Zeph 2:3]
	

What happens at this point?
- baptized into one body
	Reprobation

Roaring


“…you shall be as my mouth.” Jer 15:19

	Apocalypsus
		unveiling, revelation

	Peruzia
		His presence ~ alongside

	All three of these terms are used of both the incarnation and the conquering
SecretsSlavery

sacromanumention

[1Cor 7:23]
[Gal 1:10]

rational - scripture is only as valid as we judge it to be

mystic - quickening, experience
	"true" mysticism is revelation via the Holy Spirit
	false mysticism is where final determination is made anywhere but in Christ

romantic - equating tradition with Scripture

neo orthodoxy - says the Bible is not the Word of God
	man determines what is/isn't Word in Scripture
	...multiple "correct" interpretations

cultic - addition or subtraction
	equating other scriptures with Scripture (LDS)
	removing from or altering Scripture (JW)

orthodoxy - Bible is supreme and final
Sovereignty
...government free from external control
  "God is in control"

<Control, Authority, Presence>

dominion
...regional legal authority

A __sovereign__ is a king or Lord.  The monarchy is implied.  Americans misunderstand and, therefore, misrepresent these ideas because we live in an oligarchy.

At times God seems to relinquich control.  Does this mean He is not control any more?  How can he be in control if I am also?
  "Permissive Will"
  We are unbalanced, God is balanced.
  Sovereignty in all things
  We want to know but God withholds some things.
  Can we accept our limited understanding? and not judge Him based on our paradigm?

  [Gen 2:15]()
  Witch of Endor
  [Dan 12:4]()
  [1Sam 23]()

Deism ~ the idea that God set everything into motion and watches it unfold.

Our response to His sovereignty:
- [Is 45:9-10]()
  [Rom 9:21]()
  ...the potter to the clay
  ...the fetus to the womb

- [John 21:19-23]()
  ...

- [Gen 1:1]()

Suffering
	הרצ ~ tsarah - trouble
	באכ ~ ke'eb - sorrow (mental + physical pain)
	באֹכמ ~ mak'ob - pain
	βασανίζω ~ basanizo - torture (vexing tests)
	θλῖψις ~ thlipsis - opression (implies an example)
	συγκακοπαθέω ~ sygkakopatheo - suffer together
	κακοπαθέω ~ kakopatheo - suffer
	πάσχω ~ pascho - to undergo an affective experience

# Temple

## Various Temples

- The Ark of Noah
- The Tabernacle [of Moses]
- Solomon's Temple [et al] (rebuilt by Ezra+) (revised by Herod)


## Church
	"Ye are the Temple" occurs 7 times

	Church as the Temple
	1Cor 6

	believer as the Temple
	1Cor 6:19
	2cor 6:16
	eph 2:20
	heb 3:6
	peter?


## Purposes

- [Heb 11:7]() ~ Noah's faithful building of the Ark condemned the world
- There is a corellary with the building of the Church in that it's construction/advancment condemns those who reject God; i.e. it polarizes them against God.
Testimony
~ the role as a witness


The Word


Memra
	Similar to Logos but not as discrete.


	Rabbinic attributes of Memra (John 1)
	1) Sometimes distinct from God but sometimes the same (dichotomy)
		v.1-2
	2) The agent of creation
		v.3
	3) The agent of salvation
	4) The means of shakinah/theophany
		v.14 - tabernacle/skeinei
	5)Theology
	= study of God
	all theologies have a theme
	criticality ~ evaluation of beliefs
	involves a hermeneutic
		= a method/principle of interpretation


Biblical Theology
	= the whole counsel of God
	how a Bible text relates to all other texts


Systematic Theology
	= the application Word to all areas of life
	apologetic = giving answers
	central theme depends on the author


Historical Theology = uncovering the progressive Revelation


God
- transcendent
- relational
- just
- infinite love
- creative & beautifying
Theosis

St. Athanasius: “God became man so that men might become gods.”

Matthew 10:40+
  This presents the idea of the Christian as proxy.  This means a terrible weight to teach and lead.

Psalm 82:6


Godliness
	2 Peter 1:3-4
	Ephesians 1


Joining
- [Rom 2:15], [Rom 8:16], [Rom 9:1]
...the idea of our conscience being shaped by the Spirit
...first our own, then as a child, then as partners


Divinization
	John 10:34-36
		important follow-up verse: "believe the works"
	John 4
		we are a drop in His ocean

Attendance


How can Satan stand before a holy God (as in Job)?
Is it because the accuser is on God's side?
Is it because their sinfulness is permanent and retributable?

'Satan' is actually a title akin to _prosecutor_ in modern parlance.
This does not necessarily refer to Lucifer - it could be an allied angel which takes on this role.

Then again, the opposition does present themselves before God in [Ps 82]().
Yahweh, apparently, has a facility available to encounter fallen beings without destroying.
Hallelujah for that!
If it were not so we would be hopelessly lost.
# Baptism
~ the ritual application of water to a person in the name of the trinity Yahweh

The implications of this definition are:
- it is a sacrament, not magic
- it is purposeful, not merely cultic


_Baptism_ is used to mean cleaning of cloth (ancient dry-cleaning) (implying a change of identity, as garments often represent beliefs in topology.)


[Matt 28:18-20]
	go, make disciples...**baptizing them**
	teaching

[Mark 16:16]


[Acts 2]

[1Pet 3:18] ~ appeal for good conscience, i.e. a dedication of effort

NOT
	[Titus 3:4-8] ~ not about water

	[Acts 22:16] ~ Paul's baptism is never referred to as a salvific moment; Annanias refers to him as brother before the baptism

## Purpose of Baptism

[John 1:31] ~ 
# Calling

Calling
Election
Destiny ~ parallels [Future](Future)


Election doesn't imply salvation.
Calling doesn't impose belief.


[Rom 12:2] - our calling is being transformed.

We shouldn't be surprised that our current circumstances are providentially ordained as we exercise our calling and exorcise our will.

[Mic 6:8] - our walk is tertiary - in terms of _us_.

As far as the walk: we are not told the gait, only the mode.
And it comes after being just and being kindly.


## Election


Christiconicism


Every part of Scripture (?even nature?) has a gospel flavor.
He is the icon of all truths.
# Christology


## Nature

Jesus is fully man and fully God.
Hypostasis = the union of the two kinds (divine + human)


## Right Hand of God

[Acts 7:55]
[Eph 1:20]
[Col 3:1]
[Heb 1:3,13]
[1Pet 3:22]
[Rev 5:1]


## Parachoresis

Jesus made use of his physical body at the same time as His divinity.


## Mediator

[Heb 9]
[HEB 12]
[IS 43]

## Imputation

Like the Cassican Surplus: a priestly uniform which is black garb overlaid by a white robe - just like righteousness covering our sin


## States of Christ

[PHP 1:7-10]

Condescension, conceived

Incarnation, born

Humiliation, suffered

?Descension, into hell

Exaltation, undead

Return
Commissioning


It is a Biblical pattern that the commissioning of prophets and/or apostles involves a trip to the divine council chambers:

[1Cor 12]

[Ezek 1]

others?
# Complementarianism
~ the system wherein men & women pair up which is designed to grow and bolster the Church through the flourishing of both


## Manipulation

At the heart of any marriage is manipulation.
This does not have to be a negative thing.
Men & women can effectively spur one another on to greater achievement than would have been possible for either alone:
	1 + 1 = 3


## Men/Women Systems

Feminism

Egalitarianism

Complementarianism

Patriarchy


## Key Texts

Helper
- [Gen 2:18,20] ~ aytzr H5828
- [Ex 18:4] God...my help
- [Deut 33:7] Yahweh...be a help

# Divine Council
"_Yahweh is an elohim, but no other elohim is Yahweh_"

[Ps 89:6]

This exposes a worldview connundrum.
The implication is simply that "elohim" describes a type of being.
Yahweh is unique among them and pre-existent.
Yahweh created the others.

[Is 47:8,10]    [Zeph 2:15]


## Lesser Elohim

[Ps 82:1,6]

Ashteroth of the Sidonians
Chemosh of Moab [1Kgs 11:33]
Milcom of the Ammonites

Demons in [Deut 32:17]

Disembodied humans [1Sam 28:13]

Angels
- [Gen 35:1-7]
- [Gen 32]
- [Gen 48:15-16]


What is an elohim?  A resident of the spiritual realm.
...Yahweh is an elohim, but no other elohim is Yahweh.

[Ps 29]


## Hierarchy

[Ps 82]

[1Kgs 22:19-23]

Paul's Terms:
- _archon_ ~ rulers
- _arche_ ~ principalities
- _exousia_ ~ powers/authorities
- _dynamis_ ~ powers
- _kyrios_ ~ dominions/lords
- _thronos_ ~ thrones
- _kosmokrator_ ~ world rulers
...all geographical terms

Eventual authority ~ [Rev 2:25-28]

### Yahweh

Unique, omnipotent, and omniscient


### Rulers

Sons of God ~ [Deut 32:8-9]

[Dan 10]


### Angels

Mal'akim ~ messengers


## Cosmic Geography

[Gen 11] disinheriting the nations

[Gen 12] call of Abraham
    [Acts 17:24-27]
    [Deut 32:9]

Israel vs. 70 nations
Yahweh vs. elohim rebels
- [Deut 4:19-20]
- [Deut 17:2-3]
- [Deut 29:24-26]
- [Deut 32:8-9]
- [Deut 32:17]
- [Deut 32:43]

Meeting Yahweh
- [1Sam 26:17-19]
- [2Kgs 5:17-19]
- [Dan 10:13,20-21]


## Future

The council will, one day, be reconstituted as Yahweh desires.
[Rev 3:20-21] is an example ~ we will sit **with Him** on **His** throne!
In fact, all of the _conqueror_ talk in [Rev 2,3] looks forward to this.
# Economics
...oikonomia

"household rules"

commensurate with _economy_

Matt 25:31-45
  giving to others ascribes value to them; sharing these values with Yahweh denotes our loyalty to Him.

In a financial economy we are valuated through a wage and workload.
In the divine economy we are valuated through status and talent.
...talent is vernacular for God-given abilities

The Biblical implication is that we are given work and the ability to do the work.
This is how we derive our value: that we are entrusted with status and power.
# Eschatology


[Amos 5:18]


## Typical Topics

### Millenium


### Israel
Promises made to Israel:
	Unconditional:
		[Gen 12:1-3]
		[Gen 15:5,18]
	Conditional on behavior:
		[Gen 17:1-2,8-10]
		[Gen 22:15-18]
		[Deut 11:18-24]

The Borders
	[Gen 15:18]
	[Ex23:31]

Who is "all Israel"?

Questions:
- Does the nation of Israel need to exist in end-times?
- Was the 70AD exile final?
- Was Israel ever geographically complete?
- Must all Jews be re-gathered?

[Acts 2] sees Jews from all the known world coming, believing, and going home.  [Is 66]
[Lev 26] ~ Yahweh's dwelling; the interpretation of this passage drives the interpretation of NT Israel dealings.

[Gal 3] doesn't specifically connect the land to Israel


### Temple
- quotes [Lev 26]
- [2Cor 6]
- [Luke 1]
- [Acts 1]


### Kingdom of God
- [Acts 8:12]
- [Acts 19:8]
- [Col 1:13] ~ note the past-tenses
- [2Tim 4:18]
- [Rev 1:6]
- [Rev 5:10]


### The Day of the LORD
[Joel 2:1]


### Return of Christ
One or two?  Splitter or Joiner?

Rapture or Resurrection?
[1Th 4]
[1Cor 15:51,54]
[Rev 20:7-10]
[1Cor 15:22-26]
[Matt 16:27]
[Matt 25:31]
[2Th 1:1,7-10]

Imminence
- Does anything prevent the return of Christ?
	- What is "soon"?
	- Is it unexpected for all? or just those not paying attention?

[2Th 2] ~ generic timeline
[1Th 5]


### Rapture
equate 70th week of Daniel w/ tribulation
...except pre-wrath which say trib < 3.5wks

imminent
...except mid-trib - which constrains the time

Is Church present in [Rev 4-18]
[Matt 24]?

[1Th 1:9-10] ~ 'ek' ~= from || out of
...what if this refers to the final judgment

"church" does not occur in Revelation 4-18
...but saints does occur in [Rev 13:7,10] [Rev 16:6] [Rev 17:6] [Rev 18:24]


### Chronology
Recapitulation Judgment view says seals, trumpets, & bowls describe the same events

[Matt 24]
Either:
- both refer to the rapture
- [1Th 4] + [1Cor 15] split them into two things


### Strong Positions
The Kingdom of God is here [Col 1:13]

The Church does inherit the Abrahamic covenant [Gal 3:25-29]

The Church is the household of David [Acts 15:16-17]

The Church is the temple of God [1Cor 3:16] [1Cor 6:19]
...on of these references is singular, the other plural

There are discernable signs prior to the 2nd coming


### Uncertainties
What is the extent of the Kingdom of God?

Does national Israel play a part in unfulfilled Biblical prophecy [Rom 11:25-32]

Will there be a visible kingdom when messiah returns?

Gleaning dates from scripture is futile


### Lamenesses
No partial rapture

Gog/Magog is not Russia [Ez 38-39] [Rev 20]

Ethnic/cultural background of antichrist doesn't matter
Etiology
= study of the causation of things


We are admonished to search out the truth of things.
This necessarily includes causation and purpose

[Acts 17:11]
Excellence
 = sufficient skill in your ministry to avoid distracting or being distracted


{1Chr 16:1}
	Chenaiah was placed because he was skilled at that job
Faith
= obedience in spite of circumstances

[Eph 2:8-9](../Logos/EPH/EPH2.md#8)
  faith is a gift, not a skill - and not, necessarily cultivated (by us)
  

## Fiducia

Getting into an elevator
# Fatherhood

The story is of the relationship that God has with us.


Gen 2:24 - a father trains sons to be independent (relatively speaking)
Genealogies - a father has a legacy of family
Ps 27:10 - an earthly (?focused?) father is not dependable
Ps 89:26 - God is the ultimate Father
Ps 103:13 - a father is compassionate
Prv 3:12 - a father corrects his son (children)


## Prodigal Son

The younger son essentially says, "I want you dead so that I can have my inheritance."

The Father's character is starkly revealed in two ways:
1. He pined for the return of the younger son and was exultant at his return
2. He graciously accepted the older son who was, theologically, in the same state as the younger son


## Grace

Grace does not imply permisiveness

Interestingly, the woman is the vehicle for the law while the father is the head.
# Future Things

Foreknowledge
Predestination
Destiny


Foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination.

[1Sam 23:1-14]

Things that did not happen may have been possible.
Things that do happen may not have been possible.
# Generosity


you can't out-give God

Luke 6:38...
2cor 8:1-4


Malachi 3:10
# Giftedness
= a person's unique, core motivations and abilities

Gifts are given to enable us to serve as part of the Church.

4-6 - Spirit/unity, Son/service, Father/power
11 - H.S. apportioned ~ particular gifts (unique to each believer)
12 - individual purpose
13 - membership

sufficiency [1Cor 1:30](), empowerment [Rom 8:9-11]()


Goodness


In spite of my best efforts to the contrary, God has managed to work good in me and through me.

{Gal 5:22}
	this trait is part of the fruit of His Spirit in us

{Prov 11:27}
	achievement of goodness is coincident with His favor
# Gospel


The Sermon
    [Luke 4:22-30]
    [Matt 13:53-58]
    [Mark 6:2-6]

Naaman ~ [2Kgs 5]

Widow ~ [1Kgs 17:8-24]

What do the widow and the general have in common?
    They are pagans/gentiles that have faith in Yahweh.
    They are likely:
    - to never observe any of the law
    - to never attend any Jewish festivals
    - to never develop a Torahic theology
    ...they are empty-handed and yet saved...


Christian gospel theology is summed up by Naaman, "Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel;"
# Hamartiology

Sin is a roman archery term meaning "to miss the mark"
...this doesn't mean that we hit an outer ring rather than the bullseye - it means we fell short of the target entirely.

Sin is a state of being - not an individual wrong act.


Three aspects of sin
- penalty
- power
- presence


Jesus was "made sin" for us
	[John 3:14]


## Transgression

Even loyal believers do wrong - and do so willingly.
But doing a wrong thing is not rightly described as "sinning" because this is too graying.

Sin is a state of being - which a loyal believer is not.
A transgression is an act of rebellion - which every loyal believer is certainly capable of.


## Effects

Our abhorrent behavior is like a roadmap showing us our deep needs.
Deliberate consideration of behaviors and the circumstances when they came about are like a roadmap to transformation.

### Internal

Shame

Humiliation

Futility

Depression


### External

False parenting
	subservience to others than Abba

Abuse

Confidant for an adult
Iconology


Our appearance is wrought by a combination of genetics, origin, locale, and circumstances.

Likewise for the elohim: their appearance is not haphazard.
# Imaging


Scripture describes humans as image-bearers.

Freedom is essential to image-bearing.


## Texts

What is the image?
- Both men and women have it.
- It makes us _like_ God.
- It is digital: a being has it or doesn't (no in-between).

Made **in** the image - b'salem ~ created _as_ His image.
Humans **are** the image of God
i.e. [1Cor 3:16] ~ you are the temple

Stewardship is closely aligned with this.

The list of items above is really a group of tools...they are not the image.
# Imago Dei
...the image of God

Man "as" the image of God, not _Man "is" the image of God_
...the representative sovereign of God over all creation


[Gen 1:26]
Gen 5:1
Gen 9:6

[1Cor 11:7]
[Jam 3:9]


N'shma - breath - is only applied to God & Man

## Salvation

Parachoresis ~ salvation is to accept our status as image-bearers



## Paragon

[2Cor 4:4] ~ Jesus is the image


## Missional Congregation

# Doctrine
~ Doctrine is a set of beliefs that is essential for the Christians growth, life and ministry.  These indirectly effect our knowledge of salvation and [often] leave little room for variance amongst believers.

# Innocence


All humans are humans from conception.

[Col 2:11-12] circumcision ~ baptism

[1Cor 15:12-28]
	[Rom 6:9]

[Rev 20:5-6]
	2 resurrections

[Dan 12:1-2]
	avoiding the 2nd death = inclusion in the book
	[Mal 4:10]

[Rom 5:12]
	it is _death_ that is inherited


Guilt is not inherited.
Guilt is the reason for damnation = rejecting the free gift of Christ.
There are a class of people who are innocent because they have no guilt.

People's names are _written_ into the books of life & death.
This is an action taking place after conception.
# Innovate

## Adaptation

Does the Church really adapt as culture and society changes?

[Dan 12:4]


## Revelation

Are there new revelations from the historical text?

Is peer-review sufficient to purify, rather than update, orthodoxy?
Instance
= a particular instantiation of the Holy Spirit through a group of believers


This term applies to a grouping of believers.
Of course Good is not limited to this mode of appearance but that's all we're describing with the term 'instance'.

The size of the group doesn't matter.

The agenda isn't necessarily fixed but [Acts 2:42] certainly gives a prescription.


Coupled with this is the notion of a distributed Church: it crosses social, economic, political, and cultural boundaries; and it is global.
Institutions

[test link](./Goodness.md)

Personal responsibility
  1

Marriage
  1 + 1 = 3
  Hosea/Gomer
  Eve was deceived, Adam was not

Parenting
  many people
  {Gen 5:3} ~ Adam gathered a son in _his_ image
  all of God's children were rebellious

Government
  all people

Church
  the remnant


we will give an account for our participation in these institutions

{Jonah 4:9}

{1Cor 3:16-17}

{Rom 9:15-18}

{1Jn 3:1} {2Tim 3:12}

We flow through the institutions, which build on each other, training to attain leadership in the next.
Just War


d hear our message and who shouldn’t, be able to discern who a fool is, avoid people who cause divisions, and know the difference between sheep and wolves in sheep’s clothing (Jn. 7:24; Mt. 7:6; Prov. 13:20; Rom. 16:17; Mt. 7:15).
# Justification


Titus 3
	Holy Spirit poured "so that we might be just by His grace"

Interestingly, there is no sufficient dealing with justification for several centuries after the apostles died.


## Imputation

[Mark 10:18] [Luke 18:19]
~ Jesus said, "No one is good except God _alone_."
...both versions are precisely the same wording [in the original]

There is no qualifier on this statement: it is quite final.
So, how can anyone possibly enter glory?  Especially in light of [2PET 3:9]

The answer is imputation: not only do we not have goodness, we have no basis for goodness.
It must be given to us (and the giver must be divine (and such giving is fatal to giver.))


## Infusion

G.R.A.C.E ~ God's Riches At Christ's Expense

This grace is not injected into us; rather, it is a change in the attitude of God toward us.


## Objective/Subjective

Related to limited atonement...objective justifiction refers to Christs' dying for all.


[JOHN 3:16]
	the world ~ all, not a subset
	but have ~ not for all, the subset of believers


## Permanence

It is strange for us to believe that we can be justified without any improvement of ourselves.


## Synergism

God does His part, I do my part, then I'm saved.
This is not - at all - Biblical.
= Semi-palagianism


Laity


Purpose
  Layman serve at the pleasure of God to discover the pleasure of serving.

Sovereignty
  {1Chr 15:22} ~ Chenaiah, whose name means 'disposition of the LORD', was placed in his position by another because he good at it.
  God gave each human a unique set of talents and skills and placed them where they.  We assume that He brought us to this time and place on purpose.  However, we must evaluate whether our desire to do a work is based on our passion or a calling from the Master.

Character
  {Rom 14} is the ultimate chapter on the character of service.  Make no mistake, if you are reading this document then you are a minister.  If you become a _public_ minister will be held to a higher standard.  We require a higher standard of living from those involved in our ministries.
  Verse 12 tells us that we will be judged for our works.  {1Cor 3} tells us that this has nothing to do with salvation, rather we have the opportunity for greater blessings beyond salvation.
  {2Cor 6} teaches us to refrain from things that may negatively affect other people.  To minister to the Church on behalf of Christ you must give up your wordly desires and behavior.  Makes no mistake, if you are in Church ministry you must grow away from the world or God will remove you; {1Cor 5} gives us an example of this.

Accountability
  No one is perfect.  No one can maintain the high standards of God's calling...especially not alone.  We need the Spirit and the help of being accountable to each other.
  Christians embrace accountability for two reasons.  1) We need it to grow.  2) It gives evidence that Spirit is working in us and in others.
  {Gal 6} gives us the pattern of Christian accountability.  We restore each other and bear each other's burdens.  This implies that we must share with each other and be involved in and interested in each other's lives.

not satisfied with status quo

Lapsarianism
 = the proposition that there is an order to God's decrees


Supra/Ante - election preceded reprobation

this is ridiculous because God is antetemporal
  these are mutually predictive and exhortive
  i.e. why can't we be redeemed and sanctified at once?  why must salvation be instantaneous?

# Monergism
...the idea that God does work; usually applied to the salvation "act"

The problem with the above definition is our temporal view of salvation.
Salvation is not a point-specific, momentary act.
It is actually the re-creation of an entier life at once.


This is an issue that can proof-texted in oblivion while we try to form-fit it to our presuppositions and desires.
It is, therefore, highly important to remember these Biblical themes:
- human depravity
- necessary divine propitiation


[Eph 1:4-5]
He chose us
He predestined us


[Rom 9:16]
it = election, the adoption that we term _salvation_
...does not depend on human will or exertion


[Rom 8:28-30]
"called according to His purpose" ~ this is all people who do the will of God, not neceesarily believers

"whom He foreknew He also predestined"
This is a topological statement rather than a commentary on free-will.
God sees a human life as a whole - it begins apart from Him and, hopefully, has a rewritten ending that is brought back to Him.

predestination -> calling -> justification -> theosis
There may well be a call to all men [Rom 1] but this sentence focuses on those who will heed the call.

Also, the point of the greater passage is God's care for His people in light of His greater plan for the flow of history.


[John 3:36]
"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life"
Eternal life, which we suppose is salvation, is solely contingent on **belief**.


[Rom 10:4-14]
"everyone who" believes/calls

The people who are believing are the ones who are calling in this passage.
The belief is clearly derived from hearing the Word from preachers - both of which are given by God.
# Monolatry

The identification of multiple gods but only one is worthy of worship.
Obsolescence
= falling into disuse


[1Cor 3:9-17]

[Eph 2:19-22]

[Lev 14:33-47]


The Church is the temple, the dwelling place, of God.

There are two methods by which it may be destroyed:
	1) [1Cor 3:17] ~ human hands can tear down a temple (an individual element of the )
	2) God imposes destruction by planting a disease [Lev 14:34]

The structural stones of the Temple/Church are the believers.

Those that are diseased are removed.

It is possible that an entire ministry may thus be disbanded providentially.
# Omnipresence


[John 1:18]
Orthodoxy
= standard, mainline religious beliefs
Orthopraxy
= standard, religious meeting practices

Perspicuity
= the Logos is manifest and transparent to all


[Ps 119:36]

I.e.  Exegesis = attaining truth _from_ Scripture

I.e.  # Pneumatology


[Zec 4]
	lamps ~ [Rev 1]

	Spirit ~ source of oil


[Zec 12:10]
	pouring out

[Acts 10:38]

[Heb 1:9]

[Rom 8:9]

[Eph 5:18]
Prototype
= the original model


We are image-bearers of God (whether we believe it or not).

The reason Yehovah could incarnate is because we are instantiations of the prototype.
Providence
= perpetually intentional divine work in all things

The purpose of providence is to change our paradigm.

God is just as active in the mundane as He is in the spectacular.


## Determinism

The deterministic view is that universe is finite, thus there is a finite amount of matter, energy, and information.
Thus all outcomes are predictable via laws of physics.
Thus, there is no free will - everything was set at the big bang.

The problem with this paradigm is that there is provable randomness.
The fact that we have decisions to make and free will is a result of providence.


## Destiny

Interestingly, events do not explicitly occur because of the laws of nature but because of the decree of Yahweh.
So, human destiny is set: loyal imagers & rebels.
However, this does not preclude our ability to walk the path autonomously.
# Doctrine
## = the essentials of the faith

These are topics which are considered relevant to salvation.
Doctrinal topics should be encountered by every believer.
Regularity


All things in creation are regular - tides, day/night, months, seasons, laws

This regularity is penultimate in the laws of nature which are decreed, eternal and immutable.
Regulation


Regulative ~ only that which is prescribed by Scripture is permitted

Non-Regulative ~ all that is not prohibited is acceptable
Remanence
= continuance of a force after a creative, external force is displaced

# Resurrection

## Bodily Nature

## Timeline

[1Pet 1:3]

[Ps 49:15]
The doctrine concerning the way in which man may attain a state approved of by God.


For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens.
  Matthew 5:20

# Sanctification

_hagiadzo_
[Matt 23:17]
[John 10:36]
[John 17:17]
[Eph 5:26]
[Heb 13:12]
[1Pet 3:15]
[John 17:19]
[Heb 13:]
[Heb 9:13]

Sanctification is never described as something a believer does to themselves.


## Discipline

= teaching consequence


Both praise, punishment, and privation can all discipline


all divine discipline is forward looking, preparatory
	when it hurts its because the correction is necessarily abrupt and severe


Godly discipline is corrective, not punitive

Seasons


[Eccl 3:1-15]()
# Security

Security is based on God's ability determined by our believing loyalty.


## Belief

A believer is eternally secure, but not because of any human effort.
Security comes entirely from the work of the Spirit.


[Matt 10:32-33]
	Pretty blunt statement which we don't normally associate with believers - it is more appropriate to say that we _can't_ associate it with believers.


[Heb 6:4-6]
	It is impossible to be saved twice because that would undermine the deity and work of Christ.


## Loyalty

[Dan 5]

[Rev 13-14]
  there is a point of no return in allegiance

[Matt 5:13]
  divided loyalty makes us worthless

[Matt 10:16-22]
  He will prop us up


# Smikhah
## ~ authority


Only the wizened, authoritative rabbis were allowed to make new interpretations of the Torah; others had to teach accepted interpretations.

[Matt 7:28-29]	Jesus taught with authority

[Matt 21:23-27]	People questioned Jesus' authority
Soteriology


## The Need for Salvation
saved from what?
  [Rom 5:9] God's wrath
  [Jms 1:15] ~ death


## Belief
...belief is, consequently, tied to loyalty ~ "Jesus is LORD"
Naaman ~ [2Kgs 5:15]
Widow of Zarepheth [1Kgs 17:24]
~ were they "saved"?

### Confession
[1Jon 4:2-3] ~ Christ is at the core


The Tenses of Salvation
	past, present, future

	[1Cor 13:13] these three: faith, hope, love
		faith ~ based on His past work
		hope ~ looking forward
		love ~ looking up

	[Php 1:6]
		He who began - justification
		a good work in you - sanctification
		will carry it on to completion - glorification


Sin, from which we are saved
	penalty ~ death, tetellastai (paid in full)
	power ~ bondage, 
	presence ~

## Disbelief

[Num 14] How long will this people despise me...and not believe


## Once for Always

There is a tension in salvation where we, in our pride, insist that we must contribute to it.
However, if we could contribute to our salvation then it wouldn't be perfect [we are not perfect].
But [Heb 4:3] tells us that belief is a requirement for salvation.
We must allow this tension to stand: a requirement is not necessarily a contributing action (a.k.a. _work_).
We are not saved by any action of ours [Eph 2:8-9] - not a ritual, not a prayer, not a flick of the wrist.
What cannot be gained by moral perfection cannot be lost by moral imperfection.

The Lutherans use the language that God _brings_ us faith, righteousness, justification.


## Tenses of Salvation

We were saved by faith, which He gave us.
We are saved by righteousness, which He gives us.
We will be saved by justification, which He gives us.

Age of Accountability
---

[2Sam 12:22-23]
	David was heavenbound, thus the child went there

[Rom 7:9]
	There is a time of life when we are _not_ guilty

[Rom 8:12-14]
	Death is because of sin
	But trangression, and guilt, is what separates from God


## Misnomers
- Salvation is not dependent on being able to articulate theology
	- i.e. not all theologians are "saved"
- Salvation is not a feeling
- Salvation is not dependent on anything that we do
- Bad theology does, necessarily, preclude salvation
	- Arians denied eternality of Christ but were considered "brethren" by Nicaean attendees

Canonicity

Definition
~ Romans Catholics = the canon is an authoritative list of books
~ Protestants = the canon is a list of authoritative books

The issue is that an authoritative list must be presented by an authority.
These are the books that could not be kept out of the canon.
In a sense the Church discovered which books were canonical.


Criteria
	What criteria was used by the Church fathers to establish a book among the canon?
	- Apostolicity ~ was written by an Apostle or an associate of an Apostle?
	- Orthodoxy ~ does it conform to orthodox doctrine?
	- Catholicity ~ was it accepted by all the Church?
	
	If a book was found to have misattributed authorship it was always rejected.

	Christology ~ the treatment of the person of Christ is commonly misaffected in non-canonical literature.

	Gospel of Thomas [114]. Simon Peter says to them: "Let Mary go out from our midst, for women are not worthy of life!" Jesus says: "See, I will draw her so as to make her male so that she also may become a living spirit like you males. For every woman who has become male will enter the Kingdom of heaven."
	...does that belong in our New Testament?


Historical
	We must trust that providence has shaped events to install certain books in the canon;
	God determined the canon ~ not our responsibility
	OT canon finalized by B.C. 250
	NT canon finalization

{Septuagint}
	several hundred quotations made in NT
	does this canonize it? or only those quotations?

[2Mac 2:13-15] reference to various writings

## Number of Books

### In Jesus Day
	Torah was canon
	doubt of some other books
	~ e.g. Sadducees held the Torah as superior to other books of the Tanakh (thus the reason Jesus taught them from the Torah)
	Jesus recognized the three-fold division of Scripture
	- law
	- writings
	- prophets
	Jews had 22 or 24 books back then
	Septuagint had 46 books
	Qumran
	...sect canonized [1Enoch] ~ they're considered outliers
	...all three major textual traditions were represented in the find

### Today
	Modern Tanakh has 34 books
	Anglicized tanakh has 39 books
	- the difference is Samuel-Kings is divided into 4 pieces nowadays
	- Ezra-Nehemiah was combined

## Selection Process
Both the Jews and Church fathers took consensus as divine inspiration
- e.g. Origen, Book of 1Enoch
	- Origen defending the canonicity of 1Enoch, but gave up the banner when he was the only one left holding it


### old testament
Early Church fathers selected the books that they knew to exist in Hebrew
# Inspired Order
...of canonical books in the Bible

It is impossible to determine if there is a "best" order for the canonical books.
...the protestant canon is more of a grouping by types, then chronology
	- given by Jerome
	- loosely follow Jesus' demarcation of Law & Prophets
	- This order preserves some symmetry with historical compilations and meaningful adjacency based on content and usage of the books.
Note that it is impossible to give a _chronological_ order of the books:
- there are sequential events that are split up between books
- the contents of books are well established
	- the transmitted contents are inspired
- ...and self-contained 
	- this makes the Bible resistant to dismemberment because theological principles are dispersed throughout 


This is the Tanakh ordering:

Genesis
Exodus
Leviticus
Numbers
Deuteronomy
Joshua-Judges
Samuel-Kings
Isaiah
Jeremiah
Ezekiel
Minors
	Hosea
	Joel
	Amos
	Obadiah
	Jonah

Lamentations (Ab 10th)
Ecclesiastes (Feast of Tabernacles)

Revelation# ﻿Transmission


## The Pattern
	Discipleship
		= training the next generation
		~ the addict into rehab; intensive, then slowly given freedom to fly


## Providence
	Dead sea scrolls ~ 100BC - 100AD
	Masoretic text ~ 1000AD

	Diocletian
		"the christian is destroyed and the worship of the gods restored"
		10 years later ~ Christendom
	Voltaire
		"50 years from now: the world will hear no more about the Bible"
		50 years later the Geneva Bible Society began printing Bibles on his printing press, in his home.
	Tyndale ~ executed for publishing an english Bible
	Thomas Payne
		"when I get through there will not be 5 Bibles in America"
          Today there are more printed Bibles than there are people, and digital material dwarfs that; and we have more ancient documents than at any point in history.


## Why?
	Titus 1 - He rescued us from lawlessness
	1Tim 1:9 - the law is for the lawless
	He gave us the law, and did it progressively, to offer up as many saved as possible.
     ++We stand on the shoulders of giants++, the understanding of God's revelation only grows and, with it, the Kingdom expands- just as God wills it.


## Written Language
	perspicuity
		= able to look through, transparency, clearness
		"the Bible is a plain book", see "Golden Principle" later
		Psalm 119:130
		clarity in things which are meant to be known
		timeless terms and figures of speech
	endurance
		John 10:35 - permanent truths
		2 Peter 1:19 - satisfies the diligent
		Acts 8:26+ - effectually calls the searcher
		not our responsibility directly
			1Tim 2:3-4

## Progressive Revelation
	dates of transmission
		revelation - not amendment
			the λογος was already, the γραφει is created...from legei
		backwards compatibility is hard when it's perfectly intricate and expansive

    Emmendation:
    - punctuation was added later, to enhance, readability, but did not distort the meaning
    - the original writings were compiled into what we now call "books" of the Bible- 


## Types of Transmission

The Human Element
	tent-maker ~ skenopoios (scenographer)
		Acts 18:3 (Php 4:3)
		idiom or tradecraft
		Pharisee <> skins
	Scripture is indestructible
		1Pet 1:23-25
		a warning to meddlers: Rev 22:19
	fiduciary
		= a trustee
		men are entrusted to do the work of tranmitting the Word, but the responsibility [and logistics] are God's pervue
		1Thess 2:8
			we are His testimony
			implies a beneficiary
		Matt 25
			accountability not of γραφει but of ourselves [transformed by the Word]
			we cannot diminish the gift
			5 = grace
			2 = partnership
			1 = unity, theosis, godliness (we blew it)
			God takes the responsibility for preserving γραφει


## Authors

There are many examples of editorial authorship beyond the original.
e.g. the Tanakh we now have was scripted in a language that was codified during the Babylonian exile
e.g. Gen 14:14 ~ Abraham is said to go-to Dan before Dan existed; could be project, could be that Jacob's son was named for the place, more likely an emendation by whoever compiled and edited Moses' scripts.
e.g. Prov 25 ~ Solomon's proverbs were appended to long after his death.
e.g. Septuagint ~ many NT authors quote the OT testament in Greek; this does not necessarily elevate the LXX but validates the notion of scriptural translation.

However, this is not the same a JEDP and Deutero-Isaiah and such.
Those are largely based on circular reasoning with the stated goal of late-dating the records of divine revelation.
Jesus validates Moses as author of Pentateuch: [Luke 24:27,44]()
Jesus also quotes from both "halves" of Isaiah and attributes them to him: [John 12:38-41]()

# Authority


[2Tim 2:12]()

# Authorship

A clear picture of biblical authorship is the tabernacle furniture: it was shown to Moses who described it and then replicated it.

It could be said, with vast historical support, that Biblical texts were written by the traditional authors and edited/compiled by others.

Some texts that indicate this are:
- [Gen 14:4] 
  - "Dan" in [Gen 14:4] ~ the city of Lachish is referred to as Dan but it was not so-named until the tribe settled there after Joshua's conquest.
  - use of an ancestral name which was not given until after Moses' death [Jdg 18:29]
- [Deut 3:8] ~ dead sea Scrolls say "children of Israel"
- [Ez 1] ~ mix of 1st and 3rd person
- [Ps 72] ~ "the Psalms of David are ended", probably means that [at one point] the book ended there
  - ...there is also a great deal of parallelism in the Psalms which supports the 5-books of psalms
  - i.e. Psalms was a sacred hymnal that was continually expanding

- [Deut 3:14] "unto this day"
  - what day?  makes no sense in Moses' day.
  - It does make sense in an exilic time-period.


The point is that scripture was written _and edited_ under inspiration.
- much of the editing occurred during the exile
- __under inspiration__ is an important phrase: verbal plenary inspiration means there were many, simultaneous contributors but that Yahweh influenced the writing thru orchestration, imputation, and coercion
# Bibliology

What the Bible isn't:
- a rulebook
- a cookbook
- an owner's manual
- a field guide
- a science textbook

We are as far removed from David as we are from the year 5000 AD.
_...that's a long time..._

God let's His children tell the story.
- from their point of view
- in their culture
- with their mind

[Narrative Diversity](Narrative.md)

[Authenticity](Authenticity.md)

[Authority](Authority.md)
# Infallibility
...simply means that scripture is true.


## Inerrancy

Absolute

Full
	The IRS theory ~ we are allowed to round-up/down

Limited
	~ the Bible is only inerrant in doctrinal areas

Purposeful
	~ the Bible is inerrant in it's gospel presentation


Real believers have held all of these positions throughout history.
What counts as an error?

Again to [Jer 25:13] where God shaped man to produce His scriptures.

Inerrancy can never be used as the primary criterion in proving an argument because it presupposes the conclusion (circular).
I.e. inerrancy may highlight a problem but doesn't necessarily solve it.

Inerrancy is sometimes used to impose a reading on a text to avoid _perceived discrepancies_.
i.e. we can't abandon valid readings because they appear to be problematic.
In fact, explorations bourne thus are often very fruitful.

Advocates of inerrancy must still be accountable to external evidence.
# Inspiration


Any evangelical theory of inspiration must honor the two-sided nature of inspiration.
Inspiration is first providential, then natural.

Inspired writing is a phenomenon but is not _paranormal_.
...it is a culmination of a human life walked alongside Yahweh.


[Jer 25:13]


## Content
θεοπνευστος - God breathed
	pneuma = spirit
	implies Holy Spirit involvement because He is the origin and man is the target
	[2Tim 3:16]
verbal plenary
	= in the form of words (verbage)
	= unqualified, fully attended
	Divine superintendence


## Authorship
	[2Pet 1:21] ~ carried along...
	divine
		direct - [Ex 31:18]
		dictated - "Write this down"
			[Num 7:89], [Num 12:7-8]
	human
		direct
		scribben - [Prov 25:1]
	duality
		[Ex 20:12],[Ex 21:17] - words God spoke (basis = [Ex 20:1])
		[Matt 15:4] - God "commanded"
		[Mark 7:10] - Moses "said"
	mouth-to-mouth
		[Num 12:7-8]
	face-to-face
		[Deut 34:10]


## Downloading...
Very little of Scripture is directly downloaded in a man's head.
Additionally, very little of it is dictated.
Yahweh uses life circumstances, natural phenomena, and language (spoken and written).
Many of the subtle variances in Scripture make no sense if downloaded directly from an omniscient mind.

It is the human element that gives scripture it's genre and flavor.
It is the divine element that gives scripture it's consistency and veracity.

Examples:
- Passover [Ex 12] vs. [Deut 16]
- Each gospel records a different superscription on the cross
- Slave enjoinment [Ex 21:1-6] vs. [Deut 15:12-18]


## Plenary

Scripture is a joint effort of God and man.
Yahweh dwells in the believer [1Cor 3:16] who writes through and on divinely adjoined (subordinate) things [Col 1:17].
# Interpretation

## Literal or Purposeful

[Is 7:14]
    virgin ~ _almah_
    emmanuel ~ God with us
    this passage declares a sign for Ahaz (which was fulfilled in Ahaz's life)
    Matthew is analogizing with this event
    the rabbis never took this as a messianic passage
    ...but the NT author(s) did

[Matt 2:13]
[Hos 11:1]
    this passage references the Exodus
    this is not a prophecy but a recounting
    it is quoted by Matthew as a prophetic type/analogy


[Amos 9:10-12]
    David didn't build the temple
    this passage induces an expectation
[Acts 15:11-17]
    James **changes** the meaning of the passage
    
rebuilding...Jesus
so that:
    remnant of Edom |   remnant of mankind
    the nations (goyim) |   Gentiles


## Obfuscation

God's purposes are often deliberately obscured.
These purposes maybe revealed later...or not.

e.g. Messiah
    [Ps 2:2]    [Acts 4:25-26][Rev 19:19]
    [Ps 89:51]  [1Pet 4:14]

[1Cor 2:6-8]
[1Pet 1:10-12]

e.g. The Bronze Serpent of Moses
- quite an odd story until Jesus co-opts it brings it to a new level
  - [John 3:14]()
  - [Num 6?]()

e.g. Jonah's Descent
- another strange tale of introspection
- ...until Jesus co-opts it as a sign of His sheollowance and brings it to a new level


## Original Intent

Abrahamic Covenant conditional or unconditional?
[Gen 12:1-3]
[Gen 17:1-10]
[Lev 26] -> [2Cor 6:15-16]


## Harmonization

[1Th 4] ~ one or two events?
[1Th 5] ~ 'you' vs. 'us'

Generally: eschatological systems are bound to whether Israel and the Church are joined or not
- these 3 views can have a significant impact on secondary doctrines


# Census plenor
...a fuller sense

The Bible may mean more than the original author intended, but it can't mean less.
    e.g. events may align perfectly, though partially, with prophetic passages
    e.g. [Is 53] ~ the suffering servant was not understood to be Jesus Christ until after the resurrection
# Biblical Narrative Diversity

## Insider/Outsider

How do the biblical authors deal with outsiders?

Starting at the beginning of a 1188 page book by chapter 6 God is so mad that almost everyone dies.

Characters in the Bible move from one camp to another.


## History

How do the biblical authors deal with the past?

Chronicles leaves out:
- David & Bathsheba
- Solomon's downfall via foreign wives
- The intrigue of Solomon's rise to power
- David's provision of the temple is a focus
- The northern kingdom is hardly discussed
- Manasseh's salvation is displayed

The when explains the why 
- the date of authorship exudes meaning.
- sequence of events is also important
  - first, what was the actual sequence
  - second, what order were the elements portrayed in
  - finally, what was left out and why?
    - e.g. [2Kgs 16]() vs [Ezra 7](); both genealogies of Ezra (linking him to Aaron) but one is shorter ~ why?!

i.e. 4 gospels because diversity is divinely enforced.
- Chronology
	- Mark
	- Matthew
	- Luke
	- John


## Theology

How do the biblical authors deal with God?

e.g. Anthropomorphic & Divine

# Assembly

_ekklesia_

[Heb 11:35]
We ought to occasionally assemble with the intent of worshipping Yahweh.

The nature of the gatherings are negotiable.
However, there are some prescriptions:
1) There ought to be more than two [Matt 18:20][Deut 19:15]
2) The are ordinances given 
Commensality
= the practice of eating together


Rooted in the word commensal which describes things occupying the same space in _nutritional harmony_.

As slaves of Yahweh we occupy the same sacred space when we gather.
Therefore, unity must be practiced by eating together AND partaking of sacraments together.
# Church

# Elders


Plurality - elders


[1Tim 3]
[Tts 1]

Do the qualifications require such a one to serve?

These qualifications are _minimal_
	they are culturally recognizble


?Pastor = Elder?
	M.Dever

Distinction between "elder" & "deacon"
	[Acts 6:2+]
		deacons are table-waiters/servants
		"prayer and the ministry of the word of God"
	[Acts 15]
	[Acts 20]

	"senior pastor"
		not directly Biblical
		though there may be a predominant preacher or shepherd


Views Toward Eldership
	recognition ~ an elder is a gift to the Church from God
		[]
		[Heb 13:6]
	trust ~ 
		[1Tim 5:17]
	godliness ~ evident, blameless

	carefulness
	results


Congregational Responsiblity:
	[Matt 18]
		Jesus says the final authority in disciplinary matters is the congregation
	[Acts 6]
		the congregation chose the deacons
	[1Cor 5]
		the congregation needed to act
	[2Cor 2:6-8]


Growing & Training
	Qualifications
		[1Tim 3]
		[Tts 1]
	Look
		...blokes worth watching
	Trust
		advance someone's character and then let him spend it
	Personal Time
		[Mark 3]
			And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired,
			and they came to him.
			And he appointed ...
			so that they might be with him 
			and he might send them out to preach

# Missio Dei

No dominant theological system today begins with missions.
...this is part of the legacy of the reformation.

## Mission

Mission is, potentially, the fundamental paradigm missing from beneath modern Christian worldviews.

It should serve as the dramatic purpose driving:
- Hermeneutics
- Theology
- Education
- Ecclesiology
- Anthropology


God takes the initiative:
	He is the sender
	He is the sent

If this time (from the resurrection to the 2nd coming) is ordained to reach the nations then doesn't it follow that the sent people are sent to that end?


## Imago Dei

From a missional perspective, what does it mean to be human?

[Gen 1:26]()
[Gen 5:1]()
[Gen 9:6]()

[1Cor 11:7]()
[Jam 3:9]()

# Faithfulness
~ Persuasion unto conviction of truth.

This is less of our modern thinking which moves toward simple ongoing presence or even profession.
The Biblical concept is driving at the character of the faithful one to adhere to a creed.
# Forbearance
~ Restraining, patient tolerance.

This is quite apart from mere patience because the Christian who grows will incur ever-increasing difficulty of tasks in the spiritual war.

Etymology gives hints of long-suffering passion.
# Fruit

1. [Love](Love)
2. [Joy](Joy)
3. [Peace](Peace)
4. [Forbearance](Forbearance)
5. [Kindness](Kindness)
6. [Virtue](Virtue)
7. [Faithfulness](Faithfulness)
8. [Meekness](Meekness)
9. [Temperance](Temperance)

This list derives from [Gal 5:22-23].
There are two important considerations:
- Nowhere, and at no time, have these qualities been outlawed [Gal 5:23]
- The term is _singular_: 'fruit'.  These are not qualities that we can improve as in a skill; rather, these are evidences of an indwelling Spirit.  Further, they are attained by relationship with Yahweh - not through study or practice (which are also derivative).
# Joy
~ Unremitting delight.

Not to be confused with happiness, which is temporary, the Biblical idea is unshakeable, hopeful, courageous cheer.
# Kindness
~ Interpersonal moral excellence.
# Love
~ Charity towards others without gain.
# Meekness
~ Mild, conductive disposition.


Meekness is a state of being, not a lack of being.
Meekness is not weakness - it is strength under control...hence, the conduit nature of it (think beatitudanally).
# Peace
~ Soulward quietness.

The Bible often associates peacefulness with rest and quiet by implication.
# Fruit

# Temperance
~ Moderaton in thought and action.

Moderation is important in self-control.
We must act and think as a prerequisite to temperant needs.
This is always aking to the concept of the "line in the sand" - a limit which, though easy breach, shall not be.
# Virtue
~ Beneficence of heart and life.

This is difficult to attain in either action or interns.
To have both is a tremendous testimony of Yahweh's Spirit-work.
# Discernment
... the gift of knowing whether a message is from Yahweh

How do we determine the origin of a message?
It is not the means of transmission: God uses many means by providence.

Rather, we know the attributes of God's messages:
1) [Rev 19:10] it all points to Jesus
2) [2Tim 3:16] it has a gospel purpose

Regardless, everything should be tested against Scripture [Acts 17:11].
# Shepherd

## Decreetive
	Origin = Father
	Medium = Spirit
	Message = Word

	Yahweh revealed it though we can't comprehend it
	...it's a mystery: Biblically mysteries have a chronological structure
	- once hidden
	- now revealed
	- future understood

## Consubstantial

All three persons are of the same stuff


## Subordination

We often say things like, "the Son is _from_ the Father"
...but this must be a functional distinction rather than a distinction of being
...not to imply origins

Each person of the trinity has a different role & function

The N.T. Pattern:
	pray to the Father, in the name of the Son, in the power of the Spirit
		[Lord's Prayer]
		[Rom 8] ~ HS groans for us


## Salvation

Yahweh: "I will be your salvation."

[Gal 4]
[John 1:1-3] ~ unity & distinction
[2Cor] - closing benediction


## Locales

Devout Jews use a circumlocution for Yahweh: Addonai or Hashem.
Ya'ho'el is the _lesser divine angel_

[John 1:18]

[Ex 3:1-4]

[Ex 23:20-22]

[Deut 4:35-37]

[Judg 2:1-4] ~ [Judg 6]

[Gen 31:10-13]

[1Sam 3:1,7-8]

[Jer 1:4-9]


### Cloud-Rider
...a polemic of Ba'al

[Dan 7:13]

[Matt 26:57,62-65]


### The Rescuer

[Jude 5]

[Ex 23:20]

[Judg 2:1]



## Persons

[Deut 6:4] no verb

[Gen 19:24] ~ this always begs the question as to how God is instantiated in this passage "Fire from Yahweh"

[Amos 4:11] ~ 1st and 3rd person mix (Illeism)

[Gen 48:14-16]

[Gen 15:1]

[Is 63] angel of presence, Holy Spirit
[Ps 78] same Hebrew of spirit/angel equated to Yahweh

[Ez 8:2-6] hand, spirit; me/my sanctuary


### The Word

[John 1:1,3,14,18]


### The Name

[John 17:6,12,26]


## Types

[Ex 15:3]

[Dan 7:9-13]

[Ps 82]
Coinage and astronomical study shows a probable birthdate of Jesus as Sept 11, 3BC.

Pontius Pilate arrived in theater in 26AD.

Josephus records that Pilate called the Jewish leaders to the stadium and surrounded then with armed guards. 
When threatened the Jews knelt and bared their necks...calling his bluff.
- This attitude is a Jewish cultural by-product which continues to be evident

This folder contains my exegetical notes on various Scripture passages


It would be nice to [eventually] change the structure to match the Logos directory structure for easy xref & search but...that takes time :P
1 Chronicles 16


8) 3 stages of seeking :
  1. Thanksgiving
  2. Proximai 
  3. Proclaim 
  ...all elements of gospel, [Mk 16] [Matt 28] [Acts 1:7-8]

9) 3 stages of praise
  1. sing
  2. Sing praises (plurality, either in number or in devotion (unio mystical libido))
  3. Tell, proclaim _His_ works

10) glory _in_ His holy name
  [John 17] ~ unified in Him, sharing in the triune glory  (though we are as a drop in an ocean)
  Let ~ ishmat, make room, lay waste, implying struggle or battle???

11) seek Yahweh and His strength [Ps 27:1]
  Seek proximai

12) remember, testimony [Ps 119:99]
  miracles & judgments _uttered_

13) to the Jew, defines "Jew"

14) Addonai _our_ God (both by virtue of the Imago Dei and the the redemption)
  His judgments are pervasive and ubiquitous 
  ...Nature is not permissive,  illicit behaviors usually bring harm

15) remember forever (which He must enable)
  covenant = commands (in the sense of decreed promises)
  1000 generations  ~ even conservatively beyond the end of the earth 
  ...into the eternity ?a change or new occurrence then?

16) this covenant = Israel + Messiah + rule
  Note the referred lineage: Abraham > Isaac
  _sworn_ promise [Gen 15]

17) lineage cont'd > Jacob 
  Statute ~ codified,  as a law
  Israel ~ a FOREVER promise

18) FOREVER the land of Canaan 
  ...continuous Jewish occupation (the poor remnant) of the land
  Portion = In the sense of a down-payment

19-22)  Post-Egypt sojourn 
  1. Remnant
  2. Overlooked
  3. Maintained and safeguarded in another's lands
  4. He rebuked kings e.g. Balak [Number 24]

# 1 Chronicles 12


32) We ought to be so!  Have an understanding of the times to know what the Church ought to do.
1 Corinthians 1


{Eph 4} - when did God start working on us?

{Eph 3} - the mystery1 Corinthians 12

6b) Yahweh empowers all gifts in everyone.
He literally causes the effects of all gifts in all people.

7) Yahweh is training a symphony of Holy Spirit channels
1 Corinthians 13


[JOHN 13:34-35]


5) "keeps no record of wrongs"  ~ logizomai ~ take into account
... there is, in fact, a record of wrongs, [Rev 20:12]() the books basing the judgments, but they are ignored when the believer faces judgment

1 Corinthians 15

3-8) the ancestry of the foundation of the Church

5) Interesting that he uses Peter's Aramaic name...Peter has more dealings with with gentiles than most.  The gospel was brought first to the Jews them carried beyond through societal means. 


9) Paul's C.V.
  [Acts 9]
  [Php 3:4+]
  [Acts 22:4]
  [Gal 1:13-14]

10) His grace is not in vain; why? because our output is proportional to the amount of His grace
  [Rom 5:6-8] [2Cor 8:9]
  
  God says, "I Am"
  Man says, "I am what I am"

11) 

12-17) this is a circular argument concerning evidence of ressurection.  The foremost evidence we have is the work of the haggard

17) This is the lynchpin argument of Christianity - disprove resurrection, certainly Jesus', and the gospel is undone


37) what you sow = fruit of the Spirit, good works
       = a seed, the kernel

38) God grows the seed into a body
	"as He has chosen"
		already planned [Eph 1:6]
	a different body for each 'kind' of seed ~ a _body_ per kind, like a family/corporate entity

39) four kinds of bodies
        [Deut 4:15-20] an opposition to idols 
         ~ which come in reverse of the created order [Gen 1]

40) celestial bodies akin to [Deut 4]


46) the natural [physical] is preeminent - first a natural seed, then a spiritual one; first a natural body, then a spiritual one.


49) "Let us" bear the image of God

1 Corinthians 2

11) Your thoughts are private!  Naturally God knows...but nothing else (unless you grant it.)


13) the _words_ are taught by the Spirit, not concepts or phrases but  *words*

14) {Heb 4:12}
	{Jer 17:} - 'incurably' wicked, must be replaced AND it is only knowlegable in spiritual terms
1 Corinthians 8

1) concerning... this thought is concluded in vv. 7&8 via verse 4
  This "knowledge" is the self-righteous kind [Ps 19] & [Ps 58]
  ...at best it's ammoral
  Knowledge puffs ~ there is an increase
  Love builds ~ substantive
  ...knowledge is the framework, love is the meat/solidity, wisdom is ???

2) we _imagine_ that we know/understand a thing only because we have a finite paradigm
  Just the notion that we have attained something, finally, belies our basic, rebellious misunderstanding of our position - to seek Him [Ps 27:8-9]

3) "known" as in "have accepted the call"
  How do we know if we love Him? if He _knows_ us? ~ [2 Tim 3:12]


10) There is a ritual participation that Paul is admonishing them to avoid.
	[1Cor 10:25] ~ Paul allows them to eat the food - not participate in the sacrifice.
# 1 Corinthians 10


1-5) The rock at Meribah
Two occasions, the second one broke the model.

6) The example is as of Christ, [Rev 19:10]

19) Purposefully factionalized to allow promotion of individuals.

# 1 Corinthians

Written in the mid-50's
# 1 Corinthians 7


27) 


37) "keep" ~ _tyrein_ is an observation and inception of ideals; exactly as in [Matt 28:20]
1 John 3

There are two powers within you, vying to rule.  Which one shall win?  Tis the one you feed the most...


2) what will we be?  astralification?
	it doesn't say that we _can't_ know, but that it hasnt' appeared {yet}
	...we will be like Him [1Cor 12:12]
	...we will see him __as He is__ (He is now ?astralified?)


8) the devil has been sinning since the beginning
  ?Since the first day, even moment, of creation?
# 1 John 1


9) _The christian's bar of soap_
# 1 John 2


27) 
# 1 John 5


4) overcome
- when?  in the past
- what?  the world
- how?  faith

5) what is faith?...that Jesus is the Son of God

1 Kings 18


30) Was this a valid altar?
What made this a valid sacrifice?
It must have been the Spirit in which it was given.


31) The representative altar would be built up by man and *completely* consumed by God.


33) Remember that they are in the midst of a 3 year drought.
Water is extremely valuable.


36-37) [John 11:41-42]()
A miracle for the benefit of the onlooker.


38-39) The people didn't have to do anything to cause God to act.
The amount of energy required to consume the stone and dust ?should? have consumed some onlookers.


41) Elijah prayed with his head between his knees

1 Kings 19.txt

1-5) Elijah wanted to die...as he was running from someone who wanted to kill him.

4) "I have had enough!"

5) Yehovah's messenger came, counter to Jezebel's, commanding action and nourishment


10,14) This brings l begins and ends with the same incantation, his rehearsed line about his appointment.
"God of Hosts" refers to the commander of armies.
{1Kgs 18:13} the loneliness is mouth precisely true

10) What he says _was_ true, but recent events contradict it: God had defeated the prophets of Baal and the Israelites slew them.

11) "He said" ~ who?  Was it God or Elijah talking to himself?

11-12) God was not _in_ the storms; though He is the Master of them.  [Mark 4][Luke 8][Matt 8]

perhaps this is the normative approach of Yahweh: hurricane, earthquake, fire, calm.

11) Stand, passby, wind, quake, fire, whisper.
Stand - because he had run and hid
Passby - Yehovah passed by
Ruach ~ wind/spirit/breath, the most descriptive effect
Ra'ash ~ quake/rush/commotion
Aysh ~ fire/burning
{Mark 4:39} - the power to calm the storm is scarier than the storm itself.


15) God didn't answer Elijah directly.

15-16) God's plan revealed
A. Goto Damascus
B. Anoint Hazael king of Syria
C. Anoint Jehu king of Israel
D. Anoint Elisha prophet

17) {Rom 13:1} {2Pet 2:13}
1 Kings 22


The alliance of Ahab and Jehoshaphat, Micaiah's snarkiness

17-25) a divine council meeting transcription is revealed
This is Elijah's fish appearance
- the fact that he has a voice and a platform to so speak means that he was an established preacher

[Deut 11:13-17]# 1 Kings 6

1) Solomon 970BC
	it is possible to align this date offset with the historical record by taking it as symbolic ~ this is not a gospel underminer
1 Kind 19:10,14; ESV

He said, “I have been very jealous for the LORD,
He said, “I have been very jealous for the LORD,

 the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have
 the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have

 forsaken your covenant, thrown down your
 forsaken your covenant, thrown down your

 altars, and killed your prophets with the sword,
 altars, and killed your prophets with the sword,

 and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life,
 and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life,

 to take it away.”
 to take it away.”1 Peter 1


1)
elect = chosen
exiles = moved out on purpose
Dispersion = !capitalized!
	dispersed from what?
	dispersed for why?

Pontus = south shore of Black Sea
Galatia = north-central Turkey
Cappadocia = south-central Turkey
Asia = western Turkey, southern Bosphorus Strait
Bithynia = west-south of Black Sea on northern Bosphorus Strait


A common sentiment is "foreknowledge" and "predestination"; calling and election fall into this vein.  Remember that such things deal with time, so they are only interesting to those of us in time.
	God's understanding of the future is not because He predicts what's going to happen.  He just knows what's happening in all of time.


2)	by God's foreknowledge
	= predetermination
	= deliberate
	= destiny
	for 3 reasons:
		1. sanctification, set apart
		2. teaches obedience
		3. "sprinkling with His blood" ~ a reminder of the covenant


There is a frequent pattern of referring to silver and gold as "perishable" even though their usage as currency was for the reason that they (especially gold) did not corrode [though silver does corrode it doesn't fall apart like iron].
	The intention is to remind that even gold can be rubbed away (or sink to the bottom of the ocean.)  God's measures go beyond even the most enduring things in the world; i.e. gold

These lengthy, run-on sentences were considered the height of Greek authorship/oratory.


3-9) There is the unspoken example of Jesus' suffering here.  Jesus suffered, then died, then was resurrected;  We suffer, will die, then...


3) living hope
	Blessed ~ eulegemenos ~ interesting root; eulogy is, similarly, a study of the blessings of a human life.
	...also interesting to note that, in Hebrew "bless" is __barak__ ~ "kneel"

	Also note that the "blessed be" intro jives with Paul ~ it was an apostolic distinctive; i.e. the members would know sacred when they heard it.

	mercy is not getting the wrath/separation you deserve

	new birth

	resurrection ~ the sacrifice was important, the resurrection moreso [1Cor 15]()

4) 
	imperishable
	undefiled
	unfading

	kept in heaven ~ because holy things are with God, cannot be on Earth.


5) being guarded by God's power ~ protected for _something_
		...power ~ dynamis; i.e. dynamic movement
		
	"through faith" ~ note that it doesn't say God's faith, or our faith, just then general effort of faith

	_something_ is "a" salvation; not personal salvation, but that which is had in the end-times (eschatos)
		NOT "Your Best Life Now" ~ for the believer, this is the worst it will ever get, for the non-believer, this is the best it will ever get.

	"last time" ~ eschatos kairos ~ ending season

	[Eph 2:8-9]()


6) "you rejoice" this is basic belief such that all believers ahare this joy 

	"if necessary" ~ trials always have a reason: growing us, moving us, etc.
	"various" ~ we do indeed see a variety of suffering


7) refinement is a common theme in the Bible

	praise ~ approval
	glory ~ distinction
	honor ~ value
	...at The Revelation


8) unseen past
	 unseen present
	 joy for the futur

 receiving ~ as in NOW
 "the goal of your faith" === salvation of my soul
 salvation ~ __soterion__ ~ health, as in nursed back to health, delivered to healthfulness


9) [Hebrews 12:1-2]


10-12) Inspiration
			 The bulk of OT was devoted to the future...redemption

The prophets searched & investigated, wanting to discover the grace that the Church has.
	They wanted to when and where Christ would come.
	Instead the revelation was that it was for later generations, and it was their service to present it.
	The culmination is the Spirit preaching the gospel through the Church.
	"angels long to catch a glimpse of these things"
	 ~ we can just imagine the heavenly angels waiting with astonishment
	 ~ while the fallen angels are continually terrified as the plan unfolds


13-22) Holy Living: being transformed for good and transforming others
	Again we have talk of things less perishable than gold and the the foreknowledge of God; this is a chiastic, book-end ending of the opening stanza.

13) preparation and separation is key:
	~ we have to prepare for the unknown
	~ we have to refrain from unhealthy things

	"set your hope" ~ means hoping only in God's plan
	...which is the grace come the final revelation

14-16) In obedience we must be holy ~ this means there is an act on our part to set ourselves apart from the world.

	"Be holy as I am holy" ~ this comes in two parts: the regeneration of God [in us] and us being set apart from the world in what we _do_ and what we _think_.

14) "former" ~ after salvation begins we have no excuse; ignorace of the law is no excuse, especially when we have the conviction of the Holy Spirit pressing us toward God's ways.


17) IF you appeal to God ~ if you claim to be His child then you must know:
	~ He judges impartally
	~ He judges according to works

	In light of that we should "conduct yourselves in reverence" ~ do everything with that constant understanding that God behind every corner

	"living as strangers" ~ we are sojourners, just passing through
	...however, while we are here we are expected to be ambassadors and recruiters

18) you were redeemed from your empty way of life
	~ true for the Chaldean, Abraham, who was set apart physically and spiritually
	~ true for us who are surrounded with the distractions of post-christendom

-19) we were not ransomed with money but something more valuable and enduring: the blood of the pure sacrifice: Jesus.
	Its always interesting that blood- messy, sticky, stinky- represents the purity.  It is a truly idealistic view of the fluid; cleanliness through carnage, victory through slauhter is quite a sobering necessity.

20) "last times" ~ eschatos chronos ~ these current days
	...for YOU

21) "so that" ~=  belief ~ obedience ~ purity ~ brotherly love
	"imperishable" seed ~ the Word of God
	...this is quite literally, obviously true: we have more scripture today than Peter did; more than any reformation father did.
1 Peter 3


14-22) typology
	assumes great flood & Nephilim typify messiah
		type = foreshadowing
This passage portrays baptism as an act of spiritual warfare.
The _type_ of baptism is a foreshadowing of our theosis.
...early baptismal formulae included a renunciation of other deities.
1 Peter 4


1-6) Part of the reason for suffering is to separate us from our sin.
The "surprise" of no longer running with your old acquaintances, in your old behaviors, is an in-road to preach the gospel.
"They now live" ~ there is a legacy of every person.
i.e. "honor your father/mother" doesn't end with death; we all live "in spirit" beyond our current timespace via influence of others.


7) sober-minded ~ sophroneo ~ sound judgment, clear headed;
This is an understanding that YOU are the enemy and the world _is_ doing everything to isolate you and weaken your testimony.
[Matt 24:12]()
[Rev 2:4-5]()
Pragmatism ~ a necessary preclusion of things inhibiting our prayer life.


10) A gift is a responsibility, it must be utilized in service; this use is a primary stewardship.


11) two categories of gifts: speaking and serving
The end of all acts is glory to God.


12-19) Trials are often incurred by congregations.

12) Why be alarmed at trial/suffering? it is not unusual for us...

14) Insults beget blessings because that is God's nature- to care for His children in their suffering.

15-16) There is shame in lawful punishment but not in the unlawful.


17) Judgment begins with believers...at a certain point only the unfaithful are left to be judged.
A rhetorical question to which the answer is in the next verse.

18) Those who do not obey the gospel will not be saved.
# 1 Peter 5


8) [Ps 51]()


10) In light of eternity: all of life is a little while.
1 Peter




The whole epistle accords with the Lord's prayer
Father: 1:3-2:2
in heaven: 1:4
hallowed be Thy name: 1:15-16, 3:15
thy kingdom come: 2:9
thy will be done: 2:15, 3:17
daily bread: 5:7
forgiveness of sins: 4:8
temptation: 4:12
deliverance: 4:18


Who?
    wrote it: Apostle Peter
    wrote to: 10 tribes, scattered


What?
    Christ ... brings us to God
    Jesus preached to fallen spirits
    Baptism...saves?
    - [Luke 7:46-48] ~ proof of faith
    - tenses: past, present, future
        < I was saved ~ born again
        - I am saved ~ sin, old man
        > I will be saved ~ 2nd coming, New Eden
    Jesus is now in charge


When?
    Likely written during Nero's persecution ~ 63 A.D.


Where?
    from "Babylon" ~ Rome
    to dispersed people (Diaspora)


Why?
    out of obedience
    encouragement
# 1 Samuel 15


24) "I have sinned because I transgressed" ~ a common heterodox hamartiology.
Sin is not an act but a state of being.
Sin is a fallen nature, not wrongdoing.
1 Samuel 16






25) The appearance of David was useful to God but it was not the basis of his appointment or election.
Yahweh's desires believing loyalty and equips His followers thusly via the Spirit.
# 1 Samuel 17

I wonder how many of David's future cohort, his mighty men, were cowering in the camp prior to this fight.


4-7) Goliath was both a physical and a technological marvel.

4) Champion ~ a'sh_hbnim, the man between the two


8) "Am I not a Philistine?". Am I not your and your God's enemy?
The world does continually, loudly mock the gospel and Scripture.


11) "dismayed" ~ afraid of what might be

12-14) it's possible that David had a different mother than the older brothers


25) "free in Israel" means free from taxes


David gives theology lessons to his brothers, his king, his nation, and his enemy.


34-36) David's combat resume


37) David begins by understanding Yahweh's setup; he ends with a natural conclusion based on the circumstances _created by Yahweh_.
David understands and receives God's faithfulness through grace - progressive growth [Eph 2:8].

38) Perhaps Saul thought to gain recognition by having his armour visible; perhaps he truly thought he was helping David; perhaps he just didn't know better.  Perhaps it was all of these.

38-39) clothing another in your own armor is anathema, we must don God-given armor [Eph 6]()

40) He took five stones... Goliath had 4 brothers: Lahmi, Ishbibenob, Saph, and an unnamed


51) David used the enemy's weapon against him.


54) He took Goliath's head to Jerusalem, which was not controlled by Israel but by the Jebusites

1 Samuel 23


Word comes to David that Philistines are attacking Keilah.
David prayed, asking Yahweh if he should attack "these" Philistines.
Yahweh says "Yes."
David's men balk: they are too afraid.
David asked God again.
Yahweh, again, says "Yes."
So, they go and win the fight.

David asks God if Saul will attack him.
Yahweh says, "Yes."
David asks if the people in Keilah will give him up.
Yahweh says, "Yes."



11-12)
Foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination.
# 1 Samuel 24


1) Author gloss over the details of the battle with the Philistines to keep us focused on the Saul/David dynamic.


3) relieve himself
...Saul is vulnerable
...literal translation is "cover his feet"

4) David's men are interpreting mystical, providential events toward their desire.  They are not quoting words of Yahweh.


8) 
bowed - David responds from his strong position with humility.

# 1 Samuel 3


10) A theophany ~ "the LORD came and _stood_"
1 Samuel 4


3-4) They are seeking to apply God to their circumstances.
This is a fundamentally debased worldview.
...and look who's in charge: Hophni and Phineas.
1 Samuel 5


Dagon twice submitted:
v.3 ~ fallen face down; "they put him back in his place"
v.4-7 ~ headless and handless; they no longer tread in Dagon's space; they cast out Yahweh's ark.
God is doing to Dagon as his warriors did to their fallen opponents.

5-6) Ashdod means effusion or theft.

5) "to this day" which is when?  Probably into David's day.

6) "the hand of the LORD"...but Dagon had no hands.


8) they did not attempt to destroy the ark
They took the ark to Gath [Wine-Press].

They have now rejected the ultimate God as well as the insufficient god.
...and are left with themselves.
# 1 Thessalonians 5

2) the end is suddenly revealed
  i.e. as in the days of Noah, marrying and giving in marriage... planning for the future = making assumptions

# 1 Thessalonians 2


7-10) Like a mother:

11-12) Like a father:
  exhorted
    ~ parakalountes
    - urge with/toward, summoning
  encouraged
    ~ paramythoumenoi
    - enfable with...give courage
  charged
    ~ martyromenoi
    - imploring witness
  ... to walk in a worthy manner

# 1 Thessalonians 3

3) His will for your life is sanctification: acts that make us Holy.
Idolatrous passions make us impure.

sex immorality ~ _pornea_ ~ broad term describing any sexuality beyond marriage
1 Thessalonians 4


16) 
	3 Sounds
	* Lord's cry of command
	* Voice of an archangel
	* Sound of the trumpet


18) encourage each with these words...what words?
	- God avenges [1Th 4:6]
	- independence in God [1Th 4:12]
	- the reminder of the rapture [1Th 4:16-17]
	- perhaps chapter 5...
1 Timothy 3


1) this ambition is good, however it must be understood what the office is

2) the attributes, all past tense, as in, previously learned and portrayed behaviors
  above reproach ~ no unrepentant sin
  one wife ~ as per the pattern
  sober-minded ~ divine fear tempered by justification
  respectable ~ as a representative (2nd cmdmt)
  self-controlled ~ the hallmark of godliness, only seen for sure within stress
  hospitable ~ not turning any away
  able to teach ~ the only skill mentioned, the rest are all character traits
    its not _a desire_ to teach, but the ability
3) not a drunkard ~ there's an element of social purity here
    mostly this has to do with serving only one master,
	and not responding to stress via anesthesia
  not violent ~ beyond that, displaying gentleness
    unviolence is a tall order for the moral man
	gentleness in a man can only be via Spirit refreshment
  not quarrelsome ~ not that the godly avoids (or even abhors) conflict but he does not create it
  not a lover of money ~ this is not synonmous with wealth,
    it implies an understand of who really provides
4) οικονομιον ~ household ruler, this man understands the rules _as given_ and dispenses them
    with...dignity ~ both in his manner of rule/his bearing,
	  and his understanding of his childrens' Imago Dei
    keeping...submissive ~ submission can be forced,
	  willful submission is both righteous and edifying
5) indeed, a man must not be allowed to rule without demonstrated aptitude in the most private place
	  the implication is that current elders must 'live' with the prospect

6) recent converts may be marked as future leaders
  trials & suffering are evidence of God's proving

7) interesting that disgrace follows disrepute
  it is a snare to seek mans' approval, but it will be had via godliness

8) deacons are the doers, the enacters
  by Stephen's account we know them to be on the front-lines [Acts 7-8]
  dignity ~ true dignity is begotten of your imago dei via unio mystica
  double-tongue ~ lies beget lies, we should only speak the Λογος
  addiction ~ as with elders this indicates a supreme lack of faith
  greed...dishonest ~ this is maximal pride and rejection of thr Maker's provision
    honest gain is good!
9) hold = desiring it %% being inscribed [Jer 31]
  clear conscience ~ understanding his own failure AND the grace applied to him
  dogmatic on the essentials, gracious in all else
10) can we assume deaconship as a prerequisite for eldership?
  an additional qualification
  BUT they must pass the test

11) wives and children bear indelible marks of their householder's tutelage
  dignity ~ again, this must be evident even in outer circles of leadership
  no slander ~ this is a frequent admonition of women because it is a frequent problem
    a woman of careful tongue is a welcome wind
  sober-minded ~ this is to be a characteristic of the marriage as well as of each spouse
  faithful ~ faith is only built by Divine provision in trials
    therefore, faithfulness is evidence of one's irrevocable lust for proximate theosis
  ...notice how character traits and built between and shared by spouses
12) one wife ~ again, not just a social and moral necessity but an establishment of the ecclesiastical pattern
  οικονομιον ~ household ruler, not unique to elders but necessary for all leaders
13) good standing is a blessing and a worthy goal!
  service is a way to grasp God's provision and see His faith disseminated
  Christ is the source of faith [Eph 2:8-9]
  # 1 Timothy 5

8) provide is future tense: father's need to give their children a future


21) "these things" referred to appointing and relating with male & female elders

1 Timothy 6


6) great gain ~ measureless gain beyond materiel
	godliness ~ [2Pet 1:5-7]
	contentment ~ [Php 4:11-13]
7) materiel is temporary for the benefit of Kingdom work
8) food/clothing [Matt 6:31]
	= contentment, He provides all our needs (even many wants)

11-12)   {Luke 17:14} - action is required though combat is disorienting
  flee - φευγε - passionately move away from depravity
  pursue - διωκε - don't forget the goal
  fight - αγονιζομαι - strive, agonize
  hold - επιλαβου - take, possess
11) God rewarded Solomon for his desire to "help your people".
Even the want of such a desire is a step along this path.
It is also important that this was Solomon's public declaration - the good of the people.

12) The Good Father always gives over and above.

13) After worshipping and receiving God's promise Solomon goes to his place.
2 Chronicles 25

record of the servants

1) they prophesied _with_ lyres, harps, cymbals
	nava ~ who were to prophesy
2 Chronicles 30


11) the tribes were mixed between northern and southern kingdoms
2nd Chronicles 33


1)	12 - divine appointment
	55 - grace X disorder&judgment
	in Jerusalem
2)	he did what God considered evil
	= abominations God had already defeated
3)	he rebuilt what 'Strength of the LORD' had broken
	he built altars and monuments to demons
		and worshipped them
4)	he defiled the temple which God had ordained
		snubbing God's promise
5)	altars to all the host of heaven (demons)
	2 courts ~ division from God
6)	!burned his sons!
		his pride & joy & heritage (contrast w/ a more despicable act = in utero abortion)
		in the Valley of the Son of 'Their Riches'
	he also performed magics
	provoking Yahweh to anger
7)	he setup an altar in the temple
	again snubbing God's promise to His 'Beloved' and 'Recompenser' his son
	the promise was to Jerusalem
8)	_if_ they do all the law, the statutes, and the rules of Moses
9)	'Forgetful' led 'Confession' and the inhabitants astray
	they did more evil than the banished nations
10)	Yahweh spoke to 'Forgetful' and the people!
	...but they ignored Him!!!
	...open defiance
11)	The LORD brought upon them - politcal/economic tides of Assyria
12)	he 'entreated' the favor of God
	= asked in earnest in the specified manner
	humbled hisself _greatly_
		Elohim "of his father"
13)	God was blessed by 'Forgetful'
	...and heard his plea
	...and brought him back to Jerusalem
	"Then 'Forgetful' knew that Yahweh was Elohim"
14)	he built up the outer wall (armor of faith)
		of 'Beloved' west of 'Valley of Grace'# 2nd Chronicles 7

1-2) The physical response to Solomon's prayer

3-7) The people's worship
3) The position of promotion

2 Kings 17:1+ ~ the opposite reaction to Yahweh

W + Y = A
What He wants
whY He wants
the Answer


11-17) The verbal response to Solomon's prayer
Father's Prayer
What:
  humility

1Peter 5:6

  13) unlike Moses we [are to] remain unveiled
[Matt 5:16] ~ God's glory/brightness shining (yet we (like Moses) veil it)

2 Corinthians 10


5) "lofty ideas" = _epairomenon_ ~ lifted up within myself
...hearkens to [Is 14]


6) 
# 2 Corinthians 11


16+)
2 Corinthians 12


Paul is likely referring to himself.
He may be referring to [ACTS 13], which Paul likely refers to in [ACTS 22] and [GAL 2:2]
2 Corinthians 5

14) died for all, or for all who would believe?  the question of limited atonement which only matters if...


17) _All_ old things are new, dead things are alive.
We are completely remade at salvation, in the eyes of God.

the new has come... for the believer


18) 


21) The implication is: w/o Him we are unrighteous
"He made" ~ God caused Jesus to _become_ sin; it is His plan
... i.e. Jesus went to the cross because that was _God's_ plan
Why? [Rom 6:23] ~ the requirement was a perfect sacrifice

"him" ~ the perfect sacrifice, as testified to by Pilate and the Apostles and others

"to be sin" ~ Jesus did not sin, but He was penalized for our rebellion

"so that" ~ we don't have to foment reconciliation; He does it for us

"we might become" ~ He is the benefactor of His plan

The plan = [Rom 5:8]

[Col 1:12] ~ He has qualified us thusly
...He provides the inheritance and the means for us to be qualified - and the qualifying itself

"become" ~ His righteousness is imputed to us
...our sin was imputed to Him
2 Corinthians 6


14-16) [Lev 26:12] ~ gentiles are included in the body of believers who will be "regathered"
15) [Ex 16:18] ~ relates to manna which is the provision of God.
The privilege of giving evens the playing field - all actually increase because lifting the poor makes them more able.
2 Corinthians


Likely written in 55AD
	Incidentally, 14 years after Paul's stoning in Antioch
# 2 Kings 7

1-9) 
  we are as the lepers:
    1. we need to go to the chance of life
    2. we need to go back and share the spoils

# 2 Kings 17

18) "removed them from His sight"
2 Kings 19


14) he spread it before the LORD 
  The message was not opposing Hezekiah but God 
# 2 Kings 20

19) Hezekiah left a terrible legacy via pride.
He ignored the fact that he sabotaged his children's kingdom because he was secure.
2 Peter 1:16-21

16) 'cleverly devised'
		no man could pen the precise details embedded in the 1600yr text
	penned by eyewitnesses (both NT & OT)
		Dan 4
	eyewitness testimony
	...passed on
17-18) apostles eyewitnessed the canonization inauguration
17)	records
		honor from God
		glorification from God
		anointing from The Majestic Glory
18)	the disciples heard it
	the disciples were with Him
19) NT confirms OT
	the prophetic Word _already was_
	...it was 'more fully' confirmed in NT
	...implying it was partially confirmed as the revelation progressed
	command to pay attention
		light in the darkness
			2Cor 6:14
			Ps 119:105
			Mal 4:2
			2Cor 4:6 ~ equates creation of light w/ salvation of believers = light into the world
20) Scriptures' origin
	no prophecy from interpretation ~ from doctrine
21) no prophecy from man's will ~ from God's will
	2Sam 23:2 ~ men spoke _from_ God, and they knew it
	carried along
	~ like a drop of water in the ocean
	...John 17:20-21
2 Peter 3

{Luke 22:31}

3) _indulging their lusts_; behavior derived from the watchers

10) all of this will be gone

11) ...in light of that, what sort ought you to be?
  Holy
  Godly
  ...lives thereof that He recreated

12) hasten?
  He is not slow but patient. {Hab 2:8}
  Preaching the gospel, there will be a final salvation
   No heat death for the universe here

14+). Be found:
  Spotless
  Peace
  Saved by patience
  Stabile
  Growing in graceknowledge

14) spot/blemish {2Pet 2:13} don't be like stained teachers

15) {2Cor 6:2} {Is 49:8}
# 2 Peter 2


4-9) Peter correlates the ungodliness of The Fall, the Nephilim, the Sodomites- the desire to overcome Yahweh. 


10) _indulged their flesh in depraved lust_ is language that describes watchers
Who?


What? 


When?
    Likely written during Nero's persecution ~ 63 A.D.
    during Domitian's reign
    81-96AD


Where?


Why?
2 Samuel 1

The humble are exalted, the proud are debased...

Humility = obedience



1-16) the Amalekite was looking for reward
      ...he was banking on David being the power in the near future
  {4} another attempt at reward ended the same way
  David did not seek vengeance, he was heart-broken at the way it happened - though this was providential

17+) David shows mercy and political savvy in this eulogy
  David really believes the appointment of "God's Annointed"
  # 2 Samuel 11


27) The man after God's own heart, the loyal believer, displeased Yahweh
# 2 Samuel 23


10) Even when his hand was weary he cleaved to the sword
  There is no cause for us to let go the Logos.


14-17) The Water of Bethlehem
It w as a fit of weak fancy that prompted David to pine for his childhood beverage.
The fact that his men went so readily showed their deep affection for their leader. 
The fact that their impressive deeds are expounded upon shortly hereafter is evidence of their prowess - these were no sycophants.
Upon the great pull of the gravity of the consequences he permitted David repented.
His offering is a recognition of his own ineptitude and the fact that God rejoices in a diminished pride.  [Ps 51:17]
2 Samuel 5


19) inquired ~ שאל ~ to beg favour 

20) the breaking flood {2Sam 5:20}
# 2 Thessalonians 2


1-4) Two events here: The Apostosia and The Revealing of TMOL

[Matt 24:10] ~ The Day of the LORD; apostacy + lawlessness

apostosia = a mass event, 

"The Man of Lawlessness" is the beast/antichrist
...this is a singular event
...the "mystery of lawlessness" is _already at work_

These may be consecutive but need not be simultaneous.


6-7) The Restrainer = probably God (definitely an elohim) 
[Is 66]
2 Timothy 3


12) the proof of a godly life is hardship


14) as for you - unlike the evil impostors

		hospitality
		loving good
		self-control
		holiness [Tit 1:8]
		soberness
		dignity
		self-control
		faithful
		steadfastness [Tit 2:2]
	firmly believed
	he knew (deep relationship) his disciplers
15) acquainted from childhood
		not a guarantee of faith
	...with ιερος γραμμα
		able to σοφισαι (make wise)
		σωτηριαν (to salvation)
		through Jesus Christ
16) πας γραφη - _all_ Scripture
	θεοπνευστος - God breathed
		life of the Spirit -> Doctrine
	gives:
		διδασκαλιαν - doctrine
		ελεγμον - correction/reproofproof of a horror
		επανορθωσιν - restoration/improvement
		παιδειαν - chastening
	toward:
		δικαιοσυνη - virtue unto itself
			Him who is as He ought to be
17) "that adequate may be the Godly man"
	εζηρρισμενος - furnished
		for _all_ good works
		[Tit 2:14]
2 Timothy 2

1-2) Our fingerprints on the future
[2Kgs 20:19]

2) entrust ~ parathema: the implication is to come alongside with the mythos
"faithful men who are able to teach others"

24) don't start fights
  we're not called just to endure annoyances...but _evil_


26) they _may_ come to their senses...but they may not...but we _must_ persevere
Acts 21

Acts 22


12-16) Ananias part of Paul's testimony
	baptism was not saving
having risen up
be baptized
wash
having called
Acts 7


2-8) God's promise to Abraham was fulfilled via the deliverance from Eygpt

9-
Acts 1

gospel imperatives in v.5,8

1) Jesus began ~ His earthy life was the beginning of His ministry


5) He is speaking to the 120???
imperative: you will be baptized with the holy spirit


8) 
imperative: you will be my witnesses
Judea + Samaria ~ "chosen people" w/ two places of worship


14) proskarterountes homothumadon Ty proseuchy

15) among the brothers ~ the decision was made transparently


20) interesting that the apostle quotes snippets of scripture - are they really in context?
  [Ps 69:25]
  [Ps 109:8]


26) [Prov 16:33]
# Acts 11


This chapter gives a prescription for un-division.
Though it's problematic to routinely extract a prescription from Biblical text- it is far less so when it something that is humbling and inclusive.
A pattern that goes against our nature- or reveals it- requires many fewer facets in its definition.


19) Phoenicia ~ 
    Cyprus ~ fair
    Antioch ~ speedy as a chariot
# Acts 15


16-18) James paraphrases [AMOS 9:11-12]
	[LEV 17-18] "The alien living among you" x4

	[LEV 17:10,12]

	Abstain from idol sacrificed meat 	[LEV 17:8-9]
	Abstain from blood 					[LEV 17:10-12]
	Abstain from strangled meat 		[LEV 17:13]
	Abstain from sexual immorality		[LEV 18:26]
		[LEV 18:6-23]

	Glenney: "Although Gentiles are not under the law; the Jewish scriptures still have authority over ~these~ issues."
Acts 16


16) technically she had a pneuma pyhtonia ~ a python spirit, associated with the Delphic Oracle, associated with the snake.
	There is a historical context of ventriloquism which, in this case, it is supernatural.

17) "Most High"
	She recognized their allegiance.
	[DEUT 32:8] God enacting His plan to reclaim the nations.

# Acts 17


16) _his_ spirit: that one which is entwined with the Holy Ruach


18) _foreign gods_: they seemed to understand the geographical nature of principalities [Col 1:16]
Jesus & the resurrection were bigger concepts that are unique to Yahweh, they are His ultimate plan.


32-33) Some scoffed and some intellectualized: so Paul left, he let his seed lie.
# Acts 2

divided	[Gen 11:7]

confusion	[Deut 32:8]

	paralleling the divison and confusion at Babel
	...beginning to recover the nations

The Anti-Babel: the Spirit's language allows communication between all...unity


Pentecost ~ 50 days after Passover
- feast of firstfruits


1-4) [Matt 3:11]


6-8) It seems that many of the disciples spoke.
Did they actually speak the other language or was it that their language was understood as another.


9-11) The new table of nations
- Shem
  - Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians
- Japheth
  - Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia
- Ham
  - Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya


17-18) Signs to believers:
- prophecy
- visions
- dreams

19) Signs shown above and below:
- blood
  ...
- fire
- vapor of smoke
  ...only used here aside from many occasions in Revelation; referencing the cloud following destruction


23) God's plan was not reckless, it was deliberate.


29) 2 Samuel 7:11-16


41) Describes those who do the following things (v.42)
  These are:
  - gladly receptive
  - baptized
  - instantly adopted

42) Christian interactions in order of intimacy
  Apostles teaching
    [2Tim 3:16] ~ doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction
  Fellowship
    recreation, service
  Breaking of bread
    eating, preparation, hospitality
  Prayer
    talking to God, talking in the presence of God, posture
    proximity, awareness


45) Christians gave freely to each other - as in any healthy family.
# Acts 3


Religion - a social-cultural system manifesting the relation that which they believe in.  This system is often a set of practices and catechized language.  There is, often, and interesting progression which demarcates rank within the religious group.


4, 10) The Spirit prompted them to focus on this particular beggar.  This was probably not the only beggar.  This was also, probably, not the first time they had crossed paths.


6) "What I have" ~ he claimed and passed the power of the Spirit


7) Peter had to lift him up because the beggar didn't know how to walk.  This actded necessitates personal, direct contact.


12) God's power has never changed.  Yet, because of our lack of faith, we are always astonished when we see it.
  Recall that Peter was the one [returning] disciple who failed most utterly - denying Jesus 3 times.  Because of this bitter encounter with his own failure Peter is able to deflect all homage to Yahweh.
  Humans often attribute success to the tool rather than the wielder.


19) "Repent!" ~ remember that he is speaking to some of the most religious people on Earth!
# Acts 4


23-31) The apostles here understand the greater context of their strugglesActs 5


12b)	They went to the temple **because that's where the lost were**.
# Acts 6
# Acts 7


57-58) Note the cohesiveness and structure of the mob.
The rushed "together", the yelled over opposition and covered their ears as one.
This all reflects the leadership of the one to whom they deferred: Saul.
# Acts 8

27) the man's attributes:
- male
- Ethiopian
- eunuch
- court official
- ...of Candace (queen)
- treasurer 
- traveling to the temple to worship

30) Interestingly, Philip discerns the man's spiritual status with the question, "do you understand what you're reading?"
...the implication is that only a believer can truly glean truth from the Scriptures 
...this is a mighty pretension - but true; which is why Philip presents the notion with grace
# Acts 9

4) "persecuting _me_" - Jesus takes the image-bearing quite literally..
He takes our circumstantial hardships personally.
Acts Overview

Chapter 1 ~ pronouncement

Chapter 2 ~ receiving the Spirit
Acts 9


15) interesting the order and demarcation:
Gentiles 
Kings 
Israelites 
Amos 3


7) God does _nothing_ without revealing His secrets to the prophets
	i.e. the canon is complete, therefore everything is recorded but not _yet_ revealed
# Amos 9

This is a parallel to [Acts 15] where:
- the booth is being rebuilt
- the remnant is being gathered
Colossians 2


6-8) _as_ you have received:
	rooted	~	aorist, fully complete
	built-up	~	present, instantiated/ongoing
	confirmed	~	present, instantiated/ongoing
	abounding	~	present, instantiated/ongoing

11-12) 
# Colossians 1


16) [Eph 6:12]


18) "firstborn" in the sense of stature; literally in the sense the He raised of His own volition and power.


24) what could be lacking?  This word is 'hysterema' which a sense of poverty - it is what we lack being those who 'have not seen and yet believe'; it is as in [Php 2:30] where the living synecdoche suffers as an exemplar.
# Colossians 3


5-6) Idolatry
Sexual immorality, porneia
Impurity, akatharsia
Lust, pathos
Evil desires, 


9-14) The Church is made up of people deliberately brought in by God; there are no outsiders.

12) chosen ~ as in _elected_ by the Godhead
holy ~ meaning _set apart_ for good works
beloved ~ God lavishes His love on us as a testimony to others


15) And ~ such an important word: it shows us that this is a continuing thought, content before this is about the Church

16) Let ~ this is a deliberate openness on our part - allowing the Word in
...not just anything but the real truth
teaching & admonishing ~ we need to learn and keep each other in check **by sharing the word**
one another ~ perhaps the most important piece of this verse: the intent is building the body, not performance or entertainment
"in all wisdom" ~ this a call to deal with each other deliberately carefully; perhaps the fruit of the Spirit [Gal 6] ought to be obvious in these dealings.
Psalms ~ songs of Biblical content
Hymns ~ rhetorical, metric literature
Spiritual Songs ~ these are pneumatic songs

18-22) The language is, "Wives, be..." this is voluntary submission.
As opposed to "obey" which is directed at children and slaves.

Pater Familias ~ fatherly authority; in the ancient greco-roman world (and many other cultures) the father had _literal_ life & death authority over all members of his household.
! No other code from the ancient world commends husbands to love their wives ~ this is unique among cultures of that day.

18) subjection - not subjugation
No aspect of this, in the context of Christ's Church, advocates a heavy-handed, taskmaster role of the head-of-house.
# Daniel 2

A whole class of people are redeemed through Daniels faithfulness.


31-35) a great image = might, exceedingly bright, frightening
	head = fine gold
		glorious
		not stained
	chest/arms = silver
		blood
	middle = bronze
		judgment
	legs = iron
		war, power
	feet = iron/clay

	stone cut out (not by a human)
		struck the feet
		broke the feet into pieces
		...did the image collapse then?
		...like chaff = dust ~ carried away
			no trace was left
		It became a great mountain ~ filled the earth

	the metals
		...increase in strength ~ expanse
		...decrease in value ~ character

36) "and" Daniel was provided the dream and the interpretation by God
37) chutzpah
	acknowledging the King's stewardship
		kingdom
		power
		strength
		glory
38) wheresoever men dwell (h'aretz)
	beasts and fowls given to the king
	...for rule
	Nebuchadnezzar is the head of gold
39) 2nd kingdom, inferior
	3rd kingdom, brass
		ruled the earth
40) 4th kingdom, iron
	"strong as" iron
	iron breaks and subdues all things
		including all "these" things (other kingdoms? types of kingdoms?)
	in the same way it will break and bruise/crush
		Gen 3:15
	The United Stage
41) feet and toes
	potters clay = Jer 17 (God the potter)
	...and iron = power/war
	divided kingdom (part godly? part worldly?)
		but still with iron's strength
	Two Division Stage
42-43) The Ten Division Stage
42) the toes "of" the feet
	...partly iron, partly clay
		each toe mixed? or each one different?
	a kingdom partly strong, partly brittle
43)	"you saw", that being Nebuchadnezzar
		he saw the mixture and the mixing
	marriage of the clay and iron
		ceremonially married
		passionate union
		later broken
		the two don't mix, interestingly: a clay coating was used in ancient swordmaking to heat-cure steel
44-45) The Jewish Kingdom
44)	those kings, in all of their days (throughout time)
		His kingdom is setup
		...and cannot be destroyed
		...not inheritable
	this kingdom breaks the human kingdoms in pieces
	...and ends them
	...and stands forever
45)	the stone
		cut from a mountain
		cut by no human hand
			?implying it was cut divinely? or never needed cutting?
	"just as" this stone, so goes His kingdom
		implying the work of the stone is as the work of the Kingdom?
		it shattered the
		...iron - crushing strength
		...bronze - judgment
		...clay - fleshly frailness
		...silver - blood, redemption
		...gold - kingship, glory
		5 things ~ grace to all
	"a" great god, one who does things no man-made god can do
		this great god impressed Daniel and convinced him that the dream revelation and it's interpretation were sure
		Daniel 4

Daniel did not harbor bitterness for Nebu.
- conquering his Homeland
- threatening his three friends
He had a diplomacy of humility.


13-25) it the watcher who intercedes, God decrees that these watchers carry out His commands
	the watchers have a modicum of free-will


30) Nebbie answered the proclamation of v.25 - that Yhwh gives rule
Daniel 9

Outline
- 1-19) Daniel's prayer
- 20-23) Gabriel's visit
- 24-27) 70 weeks

[Jer 29:10-11] is the 70 years, desolations of Jerusalem

[Matt 24-25] [Mark 13] [Luke 21] ~ 




1) Darius 1
	Darius the Mede ben Ahasuerus
	~ _made_ king (by whom?)

2) Darius 1
	I, Daniel (self authenticated, [Matt 24:15])
	perceived (studied) "in the books"
	A) the prophesied timespan
	B) the prophet's given authority
	C) the prophet's source (Yahweh)
	D) must pass...faith in the covenenter
	E) desolations = razing of Jerusalem & Temple
	F) 70 years
	G) a literal interpretation
  [Jeremy 25ish] ~ the passage Daniel read

3) Daniel turned _his_ face to Elohim Addonai
	sought Him via prayer ~ προχιμαι
	pleas for mercy
	...with fasting (blooflow to the brain)
	...sackcloth (lacking vanity)
	...ashes (putting aside the worldly)
4) prayed to Yahweh Elohim, a confession
	Addonai
		great
		awesome Elohim
		covenanter
		steadfast lover
			of those that love Him and keep His commandments
5) iniquity (in escalating order)
	= sin (missing the mark)
	= wrongdoing
	= wickedness (not premeditated)
	= rebellion (premeditated)
6) it is sinful to disregard Biblical prophecy
	prophets spoke from God
	prophets spoke to kings, princes, fathers, and people
		of ?the? land
7) God vs. Man; righteousness vs. open shame
	inhabitants of:
		Judah
		Jerusalem
		Israel
		near
		far
	God drove them away
	~ because of their treachery = rebellion, against God

8) WE own open shame (recognizing Yahweh)
	kings
	princes
	father

9) GOD owns:
	mercy
	forgiveness
	_for_ we are rebels (allowing us recognize Him)

10) we have not obeyed:
		'walking' in His laws
			wading in the water
			...as opposed to [Rev 4:5]
		...these He set before us
			by priests and prophets
				priests stand with their backs to the people and their face to God
				prophets stand with the backs to God and their face to the people

11) all of the Prevailers With God have
		broken the law
		turned aside (from the path)
		refused to obey _His voice_
		...not Word...
	validates the Law because ~ promised curses
		"us"
		sinned against Him [Ps 51:4]
	[2Chr 7:14] ~ behavior determines destiny

12) God confirms His Word
		spoken against "us" (as sinners)
		against "our" rulers
			"ruled" ~ past tense
		bringing (His active intervention)
		...great ער
		...the worst tragedy ever (up to that point)

13) even after this ער "we" didn't seek Him
		neither turned from iniquity
		neither gained His insight
14) הוהי has reserverd the ער for "us"
	because
		1) םהןלא הוהי is righteous in every way
		2) we have not obeyed
15) םהןלא ינדא
		brought His people out of Anguish, mightily
		made a name for Hisself
16) ינדא turn away Your wrath now that Jerusalem is publically shamed

17) _the tempo escalates_

18b) The appropriate approach to God.


"If you torture the data long enough it will confess to anything."

"The stock market had predicted 7 of the last 2 recessions."

23) It takes about ? minutes to read aloud Daniel's prayer.
Therefore, travel time from heaven is about ? minutes.

Daniels eligibility to receive a revelation is his status: he is treasured.


24-27) The Pit of Despair
Weeks of years? most agree...
...and these are all 360day years

Is it the tribulation?
	70th = 7 years
	the "great tribulation" is also 7 years
	what text connects them? none directly

	Two sets set of 70 weeks:
		1st = 70wks as 70yrs (exile length)
		2nd = 70wks as 490yrs (time to crucifixion)
			586-516BC desolations of Jerusalem
			another 70yrs span is the Temple???  >source>
			167-160BC is Maccabean Revolt
			31AD is crucifixion

		[Rev 11:3] [Rev 12:6] doesn't mention 7yrs
		[Dan 9:24-27] not quoted in Revelaton
	
	Sabbatical Cycle
		[Lev 25], [2Chr 36], [Lev 26] - multiple of 7

	Exile
		[Dan 8:12-14]
		assumes v.26a not the same as v.26b
		...annointed one <> prince to come

	the city and the sanctuary were destroyed in 70AD ~ v.26a?
		[Rev 11:2]
		...assumes Revelation authored pre-70AD
		...assumes literal reference
		...assumes 666/616 = Nero

		A 90AD+ autorship date for Revelation meshes w/ Jewish usage of "Babylon" referring to Rome (exclusively)

The purpose of judgment:
- finish rebellion
- put an end to sin
- atone for guilt
- bring everlasting righteousness
- confirm prophetic vision
- anoint the Most Holy Place

25) "the word to restore and build Jerusalm"
	~ Ezra in 458BC
	~ Nehemiah in 445BC
		-> from here, 69 weeks-of-years later is April 6, 32AD (the triumphal entry)

	7wks to the anointed one ~ 7*7yrs ~ 490yrs ~ 32AD beginning of Jesus' ministry


God is not done with Israel or the Jews ~ [Rom 11]
# Daniel 1


Daniel ~ Judgment of God
Belteshazzar ~ Master of the Treasure

Hananiah ~ Gift of the Lord
Shadrach ~ Tender (nipple/succor)

Mishael ~ Asked for, lent
Meshach ~ Draws with Force

Azariah ~ He Hears the Lord
Abednego ~ Servant of Light


8) Daniel "set his heart" ~ suwm leb
- deciding in advance
- ingesting only the good

Daniel found favor
- interesting that another christ-type, Joseph, found favor...# Daniel 10

Interesting that God waits til Daniel is around 90 to give the climactic vision; akin to John who a similar age on Patmos when the Revelation was given.


1) the vision was understandable to Daniel _and_ he understood it

2-3,12-13) Why are the timespans conincident and equal extent?
	We may take an implication that we are led to fast coincident with greater spiritual warfare (alongside the angels)


5) A man, _the_ man
clothed in linen ~ a human spirit
belt ~ [Is :], [Eph 6:] = truth/faith that binds righteousness to us
...of gold ~ pure and holy

6) the man has an appearance of destructiveness
Beryl = yellow quartz
he has a powerful voice

7) his compatriots could not see the vision but they sensed it

8) in the presence of God Daniel's get was turned to rain


13) Nations each have a spiritual overseer
[Col 1:16]


16) whoever this is is in human form
...perhaps not the same one as before, likely Gabriel, the Messianic messenger

16-18) when Daniel's strength was completely wasted God [alone] could strengthen him

19) Daniel needed God's strength too receive God's message
...[Eph 2:8-9]


21) "what is inscribed" ~ it is already written

# Daniel 11


Alexander the Great had 3 sons; all of whom were killed after his death.
...the empire was divided amongst the 4 generals
	- Ptolemy
	- Saluccus
	- 
	- 
# Daniel 3

Good did not deliver these believers from the fire;  He delivered them out of the fire.

The image was golden head to toe.
This is directly defiant toward the prophecy of Nebbie as the head of gold.

6) immediately


8+) interesting that the believers are addressed by worldly names


14-15) Note the Nebbie asks a question but doesn't wait for an answer.

15) the worldly "but if you do not"
the immediacy of v.6 is gone,
the peacefulness of the 3 believers had granted them this audience during their rebellion


18) the imagers' reply "but if not".
This is counter to the worldly perspectiveof v.15.
They are answering the old call, "what if?"

What if your God doesn't exist?
Well, even so - this truncated life of contrition is better then your hollow worship and we will not participate.

19) They pushed the friendship to it's limit.
...and Nebbie broke to his own will.


21) They are bound in their proverbial faith [Eph 6:15+]
...not a bad testimony


25) A theophany: son of God ~ regularly applied to Christ.
# Daniel 5

God is in Babylon.

God has a plan for humility
...and it necessarily begins before the act that humbles
...i.e. there are many historical events leading up to Grand providential acts

as Belshazzar and Daniel were interacting the Persians were busily damming the river to enter Babylon under the city walls
# Daniel 6

[Is 44:28]
[Is 45:1] ~ 700BC
[Ezra 1:1-2] ~ 560BC
[Neh 2:1] ~ 485BC

Persian Kings:
- Cyrus
...
- Darius
...
- Xerxes
- Artaxerxes
# Daniel 7
## Color Me Shocked

written during the first year of the Persian empire

[Acts 17:11]
[1Jon 2:27]
[Matt 6:6]
Puns & Multiple Interpretation

Four Winds
- God's natural sovereignty purveyors
- wind on Sea of Galilee, winds held back in Revelation
- [Eph 2:2] [Job 1:19]

Seas
- Mediterranean Sea bordered all these kingdoms
- [Rev 17:15] peoples, multitudes, nations, & tongues

Beasts
- empires
- previous visions emphasized continuity; this one emphasizes differences
1. Lion/Eagle ~ Babylon
	~ regal (top of the food-chain)
2. Bear ~ Persian
3. Winged Leopard ~ Greece
	4 wings
	4 heads - Greek empire was handed over to 4 top generals (Ptolemy took Palestine)
	3 ribs; 3 major victories; Babylon, Eygpt, Lydia
[Hos 13:5+] [Rev 13:1]
4. Beast
	"iron" teeth (linked to prior vision ~ toes)
	Greece nor Rome were "conquered" but morelike crumbled
	10 horns 
	- [Dan 2:44] ~ "all these kingdoms" = 10 toes
	- [Rev 17:3] ~ 10 horns (beast written by whore)

Horns
- symbolic of Kings
- also represents the King's rolling entourage

Little Horn
- amongst the 10 horns, inconspicuous
- "antichrist" is a state-of-being, not a person; this is a coming leader

1)	King Belshazzar (the one who soiled himself)

	bulkier, and less majestic, than the lion
6)	3rd: like a leopard w/ 4 wings & 4 heads
	...dominion given to it

		iron teeth
		devoured & broke & stomped what was left
		had 10 horns
		an 11th horn uproots 3 others
		...leaving 8 horns


9-10) The Divine Council
_thrones_
_the court_
all "gods" subordinate to Yahweh


13-14) Another theophany description:
_with the clouds_
_like a son of man_

14) His dominion is everlasting as opposed to ours...which we gave away.

15) "My spirit _within it's sheath_ was anxious" ~ like a sword in it's sheath


28) "color me shocked"
# Daniel 8

language returns to Hebrew

12yrs prior to Chapter 5
- i.e. Daniel had these insights prior to the feast with the hand-writing on the wall


The Persian king wore a ram's head when leading a battle;
Ares (the ram) was also the sign of Persia.

Capricorn was the sign of Greece (the goat) (shared with Assyria).


Alexander defeats Persian army, outnumbered 100:1
	334BC	Granicus River
	333BC	Isis
	331BC	Nineveh

Josephus says that Jaduah the High Priest showed Alexander the book of Daniel;
...Alexander was so impressed with this prophecy that he spared Jerusalem.

The Lands
- little horn
- south, east, & pleasant-land (glorious land, idiom for Israel)


1 Maccabees 1:54 gives us the date of the abomination as Kislev (December) 15, 167 BC


1-2) Contrary views are that Daniel was at this place or that he only "viewed" it.


13) _another holy one_ kinds

14) 2300 morning & evening = 1150 days ~ exactly the time of the Maccabean revolt


20-22) The official explanation of the symbols

Daniel (27)
620ish to 539BC

Possibly lived 620-538BC (82yrs).

Authorship dates for range from 6th to 2nd century B.C.
Arguments for a late date of authorship (that are most viable) are that the book fits later apocalyptic genre very well.
The book uses vocabulary and language features dating from the 6th century but also fits with later apocalyptic material (curious if this book was the originating literature for the style.)
Note also that Daniel was part of the Septuagint, which was codified around 300BC ~ so, at the very least it was complete in the form we have now before the messianic prophecies were fulfilled and before many of the grecian prophecies as well.

If we take Jesus' word that A) Daniel was a prophet and B) there are predictive prophecies in his book (e.g. abomination of desolation) then neither view is problematic.
e.g. There are predictions in chapter 11 which are yet future.
Even the latest dates do not circumvent the prophecies.
Also, if the book was written later it does not preclude the fact that the prophet lived and worked earlier.
To a certain extent we see this in every book of the Bible because they were not magically transcribed as is - rather they were carefully, continually compiled and edited by faithful scholars.
Furthermore, Daniel is not the only prophet to receive revelation regarding the kingdoms of the east.

Deuteronomy 32


8-9) mankind was divided at the tower of Babel
		AND
	they were assigned governance by members of the divine council

8) Interesting that it says Ben'Israel but Israel didn't exist yet...
Scholarship has purported this to "Sons of God" which makes more contextual sense.
# Deuteronomy 3



10-11) Og of Bashan, king of "snake-land"; i.e. [Ps 22]() ~ evil rulers observing the crucifixion of Christ

22-25) turn not away
# Deuteronomy 2


10-11) The kind is Rephaim, of which Emim and Anakim are types
# Deuteronomy 32

17) "to gods they sacrificed" ~ the people were sacrificing to spirits other than Yahweh __after__ their covenant.
Deuteronomy 4


15-20)	The order of creatures here matches that in [1Cor 15:39]
	Also, the admonition to avoid worship of other gods# Deuteronomy 6


5) The 1st commandment
1-4) 

4) they will turn your sons from following me

# Ecclesiastes 12


6) The cord and bowl may refer to both temple ornaments and spiritual organs.
Silver cord ~ the lifeline connecting our body to our soul
Golden Bowl ~ the spiritual organ associated with the mind


11-12) truth comes from Yahweh
  it is distilled through various media
  rehashing existing content is the norm
  thought-work fatigues the body
Ecclesiastes 3


1)	For everything = 'under heaven' ~ all earthly, created things
	Season = everything has a beginning and an end
	A Time = a specific location in history
	Every Matter = no event, thought, or feeling is unprescribed; likewise, none is inconsequential

*) Questions about seasons:
	Are they cyclical?  Do they repeat?
	How long a timespan are they?
	What is the emotional and tangible content of a season?

	Note that the halves of each verse are synonyms

2)	birth <-> death
		not cyclical for most people, definitely cyclical in societal and cultural terms
		joy from gain, pain from loss
	plant <-> pluck
		note that pluck is destructive, as opposed to harvest which is nominal
		definitely cyclical on an annual basis
		plating is hopeful, plucking is destructive and seeking

	birth & planting imply the deliberate beginning of a thing
	death & plucing are similarly intentional, but not always malicious
	
3)	kill <-> heal
		note that not healing is akin to killing, sometimes it's just a slower method
		healing is cyclical based on the recovery time
		random timespan
		killing is abusive and powerful, healing is painful but expectant and brings hope
	break-down <-> build-up
		often generationally cyclical, sometimes societally, at best the natural break-down of man-made things happens over millenia
		definitely repetitve, especially as successive generations try to outdo the previous
		break-downs can be passionate, warlike affairs - or they can be entropic via neglect

	kill/break-down is the deterioration of life
	heal/build-up is the instantiation of life, literally the imbuing of God into things

4)	weep <-> laugh
		these are, strictly speaking, very short timespans and, potentially, short cycles as well; but the state-of-mind regarding them can linger for months or years
		weeping implies mourning which implies loss which is powerfully crushing and oppressive
		laughter implies joy which implies hoping or having some desirable - obviously strong antitheses
	mourn <-> dance
		definitely cyclical corresponding to life events, seemingly slightly more than an annual timespan
		mourning is a draining experience that, when truely expressed, leaves us dependent on others
		dancing is truly unbottled joy, kind of like full-body laughter

	weep/mourn ~ the sequence of reaction to and expression of loss
	laugh/dance ~ the sequence of joyful response and the celebration to good

5)	cast <-> gather
		like a child on the shore we do this chaotically, driven by moods
		casting is the clearing away of clutter while gathering is sowing discord
	embrace <-> apart
		this is probably a daily affair, a life without embracing is unenviable
		embracing is the second most literal combination of humans there is, standing apart when an embrace may be at hand is a denial of unity

	cast/embrace ~ making room for unity
	gather/apart ~ planting seeds of strife

6)	seek <-> lose
		this cycle is depenent on what is attained: the lower the quality and the more temporal things are sooner lost
		seeking is the goal, though we can never see the Father's face [Ex 33]() we should certainly try [Ps #](); to lose is to not have a thing *and* to not re-attempt to re-gain it
	keep <-> cast
		this timespan is really indeterminate; but it is probably longer than seeking losing and there is no real 'in-between' phase
		keeping a thing is often a matter of perseverance and committment; casting something away may be done in a fit or it may happen after an ordeal or a long-fought decision - but happens in an instant

	seek/keep ~ [Luke 2:19](); we gain treasures on the path toward good things
	lose/cast ~ these are not necessarily synonomous (one seems accidental, the other intentional) but they have the same effect of no longer having the precious thing

7)	tear <-> sew
		this cycle depends on providence; some garments are seemingly invulnerable, some simply escape wear, some are often tattered, some are irrepairable
		tearing can be "accidental" but often accidents are simply the result of sloppiness; sewing is a skiillful repair that prevents further tears - the most skilled can make a tear nearly invisible
	silence <-> speak
		This cycle may be momentary, to be true there is silence even within our spoken phrases; silence can easily last for hours - months or years would be debilitating; likewise, even the most gifted cannot speak more than a few hours (albeit with the aforementioned pauses)
		Though silence is sometimes warranted [Prov 17:28](), keeping silent when the gospel is needed is a worse offense - to which side shall we err!

	tear/silence ~ Keeping silent about hurtful matters will never fail to rend relationships.
	sew/speak ~ In this context: speaking is related to mending = sharing the gospel.

8)	love <-> hate
		These actions can, seemingly, occupy the same moments in time.  Just as easily: we can hold onto them irrationally for exceeding long periods.
	war <-> peace
		This cycle seems always to span years.  Likely wars are simply generational.  In some cases wars are handed down like heirlooms with each generation giving a unique implementation of it.
		War is purposeful destruction of an enemy and/or his things; more importantly: it is the devotion thereto.  Peace is not the absence of war, that would be the middle-ground here, it is appropriate movement toward (or, process of) reconciliation.

	love/war ~ This verse seems to break the pattern previously established.  However, since love is anathema to wordly ways it is quite appropriate to make war with loving motives.
	hate/peace ~ Likewise, in this framework, peace can only come after hate; And, sometimes, the most peaceful thing is the separation of a wall.
# Ecclesiastes 6


10) Everything has been named:
- the creatures by man
- the natural by God

+ Humans are not able to dispute with one stronger than they
  - physically we are outmatched by hippos, apes, sharks, etc.
  - mentally we are outmatched by divine beings
# Ecclesiastes 4


7-12) Against the Maverick

7-8) the Maverick is ungodly

9-12) a partner adds safety and security
Interesting that he sounds on the benefits of two: partners...then mentions a trinity.  Who is the third strand that is only mentioned at the end?


21-23) submission ~ hypotasso
  ...under-rule
  i.e. hypodermic = under-skin

# Ephesians 1

Blessings:
- Quantity
	The urgent often pre-empts the important.
- Quality
- Locality
- Instrumentality

Ironside's Door:
	Imagine you're walking down a hallway and see a door labeled, "Enter whosoever will."  Upon entering you see a banquet table set with only a few places set; one of which has your name at it.

16-17) The prayer to give three gifts
17-18) The three gifts:
1. Spirit of wisdom
2. Knowledge of the revelation of Him
3. Hearts eyes enlightened
18-19) The purpose of the gifts
[Deut 4:20]
[Deut 7:6]
[1Pet 2:9]
19-23) The inheritance includes work to do
Ephesians 2


4) love > mercy > raised > seated


13) Why were we far away?  Because of our own rebellion;  yet, He brought us near anyway.
Ephesians 4

lowliness, humility
~ Greeks regarded humility as a vice (self-promotion, slave behavior)
~ opposite of pride: race, face, or grace
~ humility promotes unity; "I'm third."

meekness = power under control (i.e. nothing to prove)
~ not mutually exclusive with anger
~ Greek term is as a salve, soothing
~ long-tempered


4-6)


11-16)
Calling
Character
Competence
Community

11) Interesting that the list follows the developmental progression of the Church:
* apostolic, generation that touched Jesus
* prophetic, end of the 1st generation
* evangelical, generations that knew the apostles
* pastoral, primordial church
* teaching, those waiting

# Ephesians 6


2) The 5th commandment


The armor is also in [Is 52:7] [Is 59:17]

The components of the armor are both blessings given by God and virtues that we attain.
  truth - the nature of God that we mine
  righteous - right is defined by God and practiced by us
  gospel - the message we speak is written by God
  faith - empowered by God we can act
  salvation - given by God for our loyal belief
  spirit - our nature bolstered by the Holy Spirit

11) "the whole armor" How often do we pick only certain pieces of the armor?
  truth
  righteousness
  gospel
  faith
  salvation
  word


* Belt of Truth ~ You are God's testimony
* Breastplate of Righteousness ~ knowing what is right (ethics) & doing what is right (morality)
* Shoes of Evangel ~ being prepared with the message
* Shield of Faith ~ belief that God will stand before you
* Helmet of Salvation ~ understanding and striving for hope of a destiny
* Sword of Spirit ~ incarnate power of God
  * a threat
  * an offense


12) [Col 1:16]


15) a soldier's shoes are lugged or cleated


18-20) The Church is not a hospice for those awaiting heaven, it is an enabler for Kingdom work.
# Ephesians

* History
  * a city in Asia Minor, which we call Turkey
  * Paul spent a lot of time there, teaching in the Church and in a 
university
  * written around 60-62 AD
  * a hellenic culture

* Literary
  * pedagogic
  * personal
  * expository 
* Language
  * faith
  * light
  * Grace
  * mercy
* Theology
  * gifts of God
  * hierarchy 
  * holiness
  * faith
  * unity
  * destiny and hope 


Remember that the church of that day did not have our Bible.
Their Scripture was our Old Testament and some other sacred works like the Book of Enoch.
So, Paul's exposition of concepts is drawn from the OT.
# Exodus 17

Already at Horeb on there way to Sinai
4 cups
- sanctification
- deliverance/judgment
- redemption/blessing
- hope

Exodus 28


1) set apart Aaron and his sons to"minister to me"Exodus 28


1) set apart Aaron and his sons to"minister to me"


Exodus 28


1) set apart Aaron and his sons to"minister to me"


# Exodus 1

Mortar & Brick only occur together here and at Babel

The term "Pharaoh" is used like "White House" to refer to an administration [from the 19th dynasty onward].

Ramses preferred to conscript foreigners for building projects.
The classification of the Hebrews was as a whole people.


"The birth stool" ~ ovnyim ~ also translated as "The potter's wheel" in Jeremiah.
Interestingly, the human fetus was said to be "on the potter's wheel" while in the womb (i.e. being formed.)
The inference is that Pharaoh was mandating the abortion of male children.
# Exodus 12

2) Repurposing the calendar


5) I wonder if there is correlation between Jesus' death-age and the lamb being a yearling?
May be a sheep or goat...


6) Suggesting that (w/ v.2) they had 2 weeks to prepare


11) Passover means exactly that _passed-over_; it carries the idea of an exemption


13b; 29a) Yahweh himself struck down "all the firstborn of Egypt"


23) Moses adds them but about God passing over meaning: not allowing the destroyer to enter; in v.29 God takes personal responsibility for killing the firstborn
[Ps 78:49]()
[Ez 10]()


29) the LORD does the killing


36) Interesting flavor of "favor" ~ this was not lovingkindness but a grace of gifts (out of fear, maybe out of hope for a _blessing of adjacency_ i.e. v.33 "we shall all be dead")

  "They let them have what[ever]" ~ Israel must have taken everything they could carry.  The Egyptians were so cowed that they did not refuse any take.


40-41) 430yrs in captivity, and now 476yrs until Solomon's reign [1Kgs 6:1]()
  ...this is probably an estimate or numerology; 
  - Stephen estimates further in [Acts 7:6]() @ 400yrs ~ this is given as the time of enslavement, implying that it was 30yrs before the Israelites were enslaved


43-49) Gentile inclusion


51) "All the people of Israel did..." probably the last time this was true.

# Exodus 16

The test refers to the ark of the covenant which hasn't been built yet.
# Exodus 2

Midian
~ future enemies of Israel
~ around Gulf of Aqaba
~ [Gen 25:1-6]
~ [Gen 35:25+] caravaners who pickup Joseph
- perhaps a family of Ishmaelites, both lineages from Abraham
- they are cousins of Israel

[Ex 17] ~ Horeb chronologically before Sinai

[Ex 2:18,21] ~ Ruel, Moses father-in-law
[Ex 3:1] ~ Jethro, Moses father-in-law
[Jdg 4:11] ~ Hobab, father-in-law of Moses
# Exodus 20


2-6) The first two _commandments_ are not behaviors to be avoided but to be done.


8-11) One day per week should be set apart for rest.  


12) This is lifelong: even after the parents perish the child honors them through remembrance and respect for their legacy (i.e. siblings and investments.)


15) God does supports private property
covetousness is idolatry
# Exodus 23


20-22) A promise of theophany
- Yahweh's name is _in_ Him
- ability to pardon sin
# Exodus 3

Mt Sinai is in Edom & Midian
Exodus 30


4+) Offering oil
	gold | deity
	frankincense | priesthood
	myrrh | death

	[Is 60] - he gets only gold & frankincense, no myrrh (no more death)
# Exodus 33


16) What is the believer's distinctive?  It is the presence of God.
# Exodus 34

29-33) It was obvious to others that Moses had been with God - but not to him
God's people feared his radiance
He covered his face - after speaking to God's people
# Exodus


The late date for the exodus is 1200BC, for which there is no archaelogical evidence.

The early date for the exodus is 1400BC, for which there is concordance with archaeology.
...and there is evidence of a destruction of Jericho's walls around this time.


Early date = 1446BC (from [1Kgs 6:1])



Writing ascribed to Moses

Basic Outline
- 1:1 - 15:21		Egypt
	Moses early life models and prefigures the coming evolution of the nation of Israel
	- born to oppression
	- water ordeal
	- in-fighting
	- fleeing to the desert
	- burning revelation
- 15:22 - 18:27		to Sinai
- 19:1 + 			in Sinai


Chronology quibbles
16:34 ~ precedes the ark's construction
Ezekiel 1


The imagery herein correlates almost perfectly with the man-made tabernacle in [Ex 31]-[Ex 33] and elsewhere.


1)	30th year of what?
		His own age?
		3-decades after the finding of the law?
Ezekiel 28


Eden, God's holy mountain
	{Gen 3}

moshav elohim ~ seat of the gods

12-13) the glory of a created being [also] at the level of an elohim

13) an indication of divinity?  covered in *light* (i.e. the specturm of decomposed light) - but there are nine stones here ?how many colors?
	{Job 38:7} {Is 14:12-13} divine entities as stars

	Ezekiel 11


3) Those who thought they were in the good were not.
The haughty wrongly parsed their circumstances and did not understand how God was working.

15-16) God exiled _His imagers_ - they were to be spared future punishment.

16)	"I have been a sanctuary" ~ for the indwelt believer the sacred space is within them [1Cor 3:16]
Ezekiel 14


14,20) Daniel and Ezekiel were contemporaries: Daniel was a 1st wave exile, Ezekiel was 2nd wave.
This either a later edit OR Daniel was already as famous as Job & Noah OR this is Ugaritic Don'el was a famous figure at the time.
Either position is workable and does not undermine inspiration.
Interestingly, [Ezek 28] is full of Ugaritic material AND that would modulate these three being non-Jews.
BUT Don'el is a pagan...not a Yahwehist.


21) Sword, Famine, Wild-Beast(s), and Pestilence are not only tangible judgments but references to divine council-members who specialize in such things.# Ezekiel 31

Yhwh is the tree-gardener; he causes them to be, rise, and fall

written around June 587 BC

The cosmic tree resembles the ?Maesu? tree of Babylonian myths


2) To: Pharaoh AND Eygpt

3) Assyria is compared to the cosmic tree


6) birds ~ satanic messengers (accusers)


8-9) _garden of Yhwh_


16-17) ritual mourning for the tree
This describes the _trees_ regretting the downfall of the _cosmic tree_
# Ezekiel 32


The lion and the dragon
	CT-13 references Teanok who has Tani'im lion/dragon hybrid iconography
	terrifying power


21-24) _rephai'im_ do not appear here


27) here we have gebori'im nephilim that are _not_ evil
[Gen 6:4]
[Is 14]


inquities on bones ~ 
- may be 'shields' via copyist error
- may be distinctive markings

# Ezekiel 34


By way of counter-example, a shepherd should:
* feed the sheep
* feed them well
* give strength training
* nurture the sick
* get the strays
* rule with mercy and grace
* protect from predators
* not relinquish their followers

# Ezekiel 37

The resurrection is 2-phase: flesh, then spirit


11) These bones are "the whole house of Israel."  These are the people of God, not the world, that are resurrected as an army.  This is not an end-times resurrection but a historical one made to fight God's battles.
  Tony Evans: nominal christians are like Frankenstein's monster - anatomically/structurally correct but lifeless
Ezekiel 43


13-17) The Altar

Altar hearth ~ ha'har'el ~ mountain of God
Ezekiel 5


5) "center of the earth"
also in [Eze 38:12], Jerusalem has become (and will be) the political and spiritual focus of the world
Jerusalem is also the center of the temple patrimony
...perhaps more better as "navel" of the earth
Two genealogies for Ezra:
  Numbers 16
  Ezra 7


Numbers 16 gives 27
generations whereas Ezra 7 gives 20 generations _for the same
time-span_.  If we take Levi thru Aaron to be around 450yrs, plus
20yr/gen after then the Numbers account would push Ezra into the 2nd
century...conversely the genealogy in Ezra puts us in the 5th century
which lines up much better with the actual end of the exile.

Galatians


Written by Paul [1:1]
...around 48(ish)


"Don't let non-believers write your liturgy."

Whereas Romans is about what the gospel is...Galatians is about what the gospel isn't.


[Acts 15] ~ background
Galatians 1


Galatians 2


Paul was made an example by God - we shant overlook the incredible humility of Paul, evidenced not by his account but by the relationships he had.

Legalism is just another refactoring of sympathetic magic: we do something to influence divine power.  This is a farse in all implementations.  God shakes His head;  the fallen laugh and work us over.

Barnabas was born "Joseph"
= son of encouragement

[Prov 29:25]


2) [Acts 11] OR [Acts 15]

3) Paul refutes circumcision as saving.
However, in [Acts 16] Paul has Timothy circumcised precedent to his ministry to Jews.

4) The Church today is infiltrated by moralists.


6) "seemed" ~ powerful influence is more typically subversive [Col 1:17]


10) Who are the poor?  The Jerusalem Church, which was very needy - mostly Jews.


[Jam 2]
[Gal 3:10]


"The prodigal son spent one half of his inheritance on wine, women, and whimsy - and wasted the other half."  Chuck Missler


11) Peter @ Antioch
I think it's interesting that Peter is called by his Greek name here, and that it is so similar to Caiaphas...the one who orchestrated Christ's death.
Is this a verbal cue?

Cephasian = one who creates religious demarcations


14) "Answer a fool according to his folly..."

15)	This is not to imply that Jews are not sinners...rather he is differentiating one type of sinner from another.

16)	Jews know a person is not justified by the law
	...we have come to know that faith in Jesus Christ justifies - therefore we believe

17)	How does he equate justification with servanthood?
	'seeking to be justified' - the justification of Christ is once for all, any further pursuit along those line is fruitless and heterodox.
	We have a fiduciary responsibility to testify with our gifts: if we indulge in sin alongside our ministry we are not serving Christ.
		[1Pet 3:7] ~ betrayal of an oath separates us from God

18)	Guilt reigns.
	There is desire to rebuild unless we know what we were meant to be [1Cor 3:10]
	In a way we showcase our (former) depravity by building on the work of Christ.

19) Thank God for the law!
	Without it I would never have known of my need for Him!
	Without it I could never have divorced the world and been betrothed to Him!  [Rom 7]

20)	Crucified with Christ - I take this literally: a part of us died on that tree, needfully so.
	We are not cleaned up and put into play; we are burned up and remade.
	Instinct says this must be figurative but intuition says, 'No'.
	Part of me wonders if there is truly some change in the organism due to salvation?
	But it cannot be so, or else there would be the capability to exercise our propensity for upsmanship and segregation.
	That physical element, whatever it is (in detail), is the faith that He gives [Eph 2:8-9]

	"loved and gave", the past tense here is so important.
	There are many elements of salvation that are present or future tense - but not here.
	The gift of Christ must always be in the past because it preceded my sin.
	~ [1Jon 3:16] love could not be greater because it was complete, preceded my sin, and was given in full knowledge of my further rebellion.

21)	It was that same gift [20] that justified us.
	The justification was not done through the law - the law never justified.
	
Galatians 3

Dominion's of the law:
- societal
- moral
- civil
- prophetic
- sacrificial

Naaman's salvation, and membership, was not contingent on _any_ act of his.  Elisha's response to him is as God's to us, "go in peace."


What is the obedient Christian obeying?  
- The law of Christ
- [1Jon 2:28]


1) The Greek language here is similar to [Deut 28:54] which cleverly comports legalism with a psychopathic mindset - and the notion that Jesus Christ is the only solution.


6-7) [Gen 15:6]
	[Gen 22] ~ the akidah

8-9) [Gen 12:3]

10) [Deut 27:26]

11) [Hab 2:4]

12) [Lev 18:5]

13) [Deut 21:23]


15) A validated human will


22-24) the law a prison

23) mellousan pistin apokalupsthynai: before faith came

Galatians 4


24) Paul talks about interpreting a narrative, cluing us in that Bible stories truly have a theological message
# Galatians 5

1) once free we must willingly yield to the slavery of sin


16-

19-24) which of the fruits evidenced in your life

19-21) works of the flesh; anti-spirit behaviours
  The Harlot ~ sexual addicts
  The Rebel ~ immoral rejection of authority
  The Bohemian ~ pleasure seekers
  The Power Seeker ~ promote personal gain
  The Escape Addict ~ drug addict
  The Professional Victim ~ hate and antagonism
  The Drama Lover ~ love controversy and chaos
  The Competitor ~ antagonistic, contentious rivals
  The Volcano ~ consistent, passionate rage
  The Ladder Climber ~ politicking and electioneering
  The Revolutionary ~ habitually inciting rebellion
  The Watchman ~ causes divisions and dissensions
  The Materialist ~ covetous in action, selfish
  The Alcoholic ~ habitual intoxication
  The Party Animal ~ habitual partiers


22-24) fruit of the Spirit
	as B.R. points out - it is singular, there is one fruit; fruits are those who come after

22)
	love
	joy
	peace
	patience
	kindness
	goodness
	faithfulness

  [John 8:29]() ~ closeness with God equates to being Spirit-filled which equates to these fruit

23)
	gentleness
	self-control

	lawfulness

24) don't forget the penultimate fruit - crucifying the passions and desires of the flesh
	passions = driving motivations that fuel us; like a raging bull we devote ourselves in singular focus to achieving our goals and partaking of whatever we will
	desires = our desires (as opposed to His); these cannot ever, on this Earth, be in agreement; we must put off our desires, hence John's proclamation {Jn 3:30}


25) Living is being "saved"; Following is deliberate and intentional

# Galatians 6


2) The Law of Christ


7-9) Fruits:
seed    crop
sin       decay
good    good
kalon    therisomen


14) Crucifixion, death, is of our worldly part.
This death is at the hands of the enemy for the benefit of the enemy.


17) The book begins and ends with an exhortation about Paul's apostolic credentials.
Genesis 14


14) The fact that Dan, or the other tribes, did not yet exist reveals that this was written, or edited, after the land was settled.
At that time the city was called Laish and later renamed [JDG 18:29]
Genesis 15


5) This is not a promise as to the number of offspring but their quality. 
The body of believers will be as the stars: this astral language is repeated throughout scripture. 


17) God ALONE makes the covenant.
What is the significance of the smoking pot and the flaming torch?
...prophetic of the shakinah?
Genesis 29


1) Jacob - that supplants
	the people of the east

2) 3 flocks of sheep - communion, believer-bodies
	watered from the well
	large covering stone on the well
	
3) all of the flocks - all believers
shepherds roll away the stone
shepherds water the sheep
	then put the stone back
	
4) Jacob - that supplants
Haran - mountainous country

5) Laban - white/shining

Polemic of Mesopotamian myths
+ divine judgement
+ chosen man
+ sacred dimensions of the vessel
+ boat runs aground on mountain
+ birds sent out
+ sacrifice to god(s)
+ humanity renewed
- some have a rebel god warning man in secret
- flood ends because his get hungry
- others have multiple divine beings involved in the decision making


Nephilim ~ 

	2nd temple Jews believed demons to be the disembodied souls of these hybrid offspring


1-4) A pointed polemic to overturn the myth of Babylonian/human superiority.
A further corruption of creation; intended to defile the seed of Yahweh.
1st Mention: Sons of God
Interesting parallels with many mythologies.
A continuation of the pattern of corruption.
The intention of the divine rebels was to displace [breed out] humanity.
- the communion/merging of the divine and human is rebellious (e.g. sorcery, witchcraft)

2) The attraction/lust is as much, or more, the desire to corrupt the human line and take power.  [Ez 28:13+]()

3) God's Spirit won't abide-in/strive-with man: God+man is a struggle on this Earth
The breath/life is not inherited, is it given to each (Golem).
120 years...until the flood.
,,,also 3x40; 40===time-of-trial, 3 stages/phases of life

4) The "sons of god" had to have physical, human form.
[Gen 19]() ~ another account of the sexuality of divine beings
The blending of divine+human was done when God created Adam from dust+breath; this way is inferior.
Men of renown ~ Gibborim, [Deut 3:10-11](), [1Sam 1:27]()

5-6) hearts: mens' full of evil, God's full of love

5, 12) Sight ~ during creation Yahweh _saw_ good; now He _sees_ corruption

6) regret/repent ~ divine judgment came from a place of grief & pain


8) Noah found favor ~ something we desparately want

9) 3 things that make Noah special: godly, blameless, walked with God.
- sadiq ~ righteous; i.e. right-wise - knowing what is right AND doing it
- tamim ~ perfect; complete without blemish; later used to describe acceptable sacrifices
- halak h'elohim ~ went with God; i.e. side-by-side living
Noah "walked" with God ~ went with, used also to describe the way water flows


13) An end of all flesh came before God ~ He is revealing the irreversible corruption of the Earth.
He, therefore, accelerates the end of the current state.
This is the mercy of divine judgment- that He will not allow the ruination to linger.
Surely part of the decreation must be to eliminate certain aspects that prevent a similar ruination afterwards: the imprisonment of the divine beings that directly influenced people.


14-21) A further countering of _tohu v'bohu_ (formless and chaotic) from [Gen 1]()
- making the ark ~ forming the earth
- filling it with life - making creatures

14) Rooms ~ _qen_ is a nest; ostensibly a pile of reeds/sticks for inhabitation.


Remnant
18) These 8 were [likely] a vanishingly small percentage of the population.
Subsequent remnants are larger and larger; perhaps both by number and by percentage


Flood
- Some say that there was no rain prior to the flood.  It is possible that plants were watered from the ground and dew and such.  [Gen 2:5]() says that God had not caused it rain _yet_...but this is not conclusive.  Neither is the rainbow in [Gen 9:8-17]() which could have been a special case of a known phenomenon.
- However, the theoretical vapor canopy and massive aquifers (which released the water "from the deep") is notable- especially in light of fossil and geological evidence of a massive, global disaster.


Ark symbolism
- vs. Eden
  - chaotic waters before it
  - filled with animals
  - 3-levels
    - courtyard, holy, holy of holies
    - deep, land, heaven
- 300x50x30
  - 30x5x3
  - Solomon's temple: 60x20x30
- pitch inside & out
  - asphalt, covering: same root as the atonement covering
  - it is unusual for a naval vessel to pitched inside & out- but for the concept of the covering-atonement.  In light of this we can recognize God's metaphysical covering inside and out; a sanctification.
- window, in Gen 7:11,8:2; the sky is the window of heaven
# Genesis 1

1)
in the beginning - time
God - force
created - action
the heavens - space
and the earth - matter

2)
Spirit = ruach ~ always associated with water
hovered ~ bird/fowl-like movement; 
	other bird/water associations
	- the dove in Noah's story
	- the bird at Jesus' baptism

3) The first words of Yahweh: "let there be light"
[2Cor 4:4-6-7] ~ Paul meshes gospel and light which induces the idea of creation in the gospel reception


31) "very good" ~ the creation is complete
# Genesis 11


City-building is akin to denial/rebellion of God

God _came down_ to see the tower; a pun reporting how far beneath him it was.

Babel means "confusion" in Hebrew; it means "gates of the gods" in Akkadian
the dispersion of the nations is a flood of peoples
...seas is often a reference to the peoples/nations


1-8) Tower of Babel
The point of this tower (probably a ziggurat) is to localize the deity.
Yahweh will not be tamed in this manner.
He will, ultimately, make His own sacred space(s) in which to dwell.
Subsequent to this Yahweh calls Abraham to begin creating His own people.
# Genesis 12


1) Leaving behind:
   1) country
   2) extended family
   3) nuclear family



16) She must truly have been a rare beauty to be given this kind of fortune.
    1) This moral debacle of Abram's does end up funding the birth of the Jewish nation
    2) Perhaps Hagar was included in this batch


17-18) How did Pharaoh equate his suffering with Abram's marriage?  Did they naturally blame the outsider such that Abram confessed?


20) This is the first bloodless plundering of Egypt

# Genesis 17


5) Abraham recieved the spirit, evidenced by the new name...
...after his call
...after the covenant


Yahweh literally created His people out of nothing - out of a barren womb.
# Genesis 18

8) "butter, and milke, and the calf" is not a kosher meal...oi vey
# Genesis 2


Whereas chapter 1 is poetic, this chapter is narration.


God does not _make_ man.
He forms man from the dust; i.e. vicariously, through a natural process.
He works on us and among us physically.


## Humanity

Here, God establishes humanity and the place in which he will meet with them.
Man was put into the garden (meaning they were outside.)
Man was given work.
He also establishes rules of engagement with them- not to constrain them but to dissuade them from behaviors whose consequence is separation from Him.
His removal of the tree of life prevents them from eternal separation after they received good&evil.



## Terracing

God establishes Eden as the fountainhead of blessing to the world.
He rests in the garden, within Eden, which is upon the earth.
This 3-tiered arrangement is seen again in tabernacle and temple architecture.

Pishon ~ changing; from the mouth
  Havilah ~ suffers; brings forth
  ...good gold; there are isotopes of gold that are unstable
  ...bdellium & onyx may be found in rough terrain, above ground
Gihon ~ valley of grace
  Cush ~ black; later Ethiopia
Tigris ~ swift river; trade-worthy?
Euphrates ~ makes fruiful


1-3) Shabbat; God establishes the pattern of 6x work && 1x rest
...this repetition continues throughout scripture and beyond

4) The first mention of Yahweh

5) the elohim - plural, the divine council
	{Ps 8:5} {Heb 2:7}


8) Eden is "in the east"; later, Babylon is in the east and things "from the east" are frightful.
This area was co-opted by evil forces to oppose God's people.
e.g. during the Eygptian exile the Canaanites set up in the promised land, in the east, being prepared by watchers to oppose Israel.


15) work & keep
avad & shamar
these are priestly terms as well


17) Man did not die in an instant, upon eating the fruit, but the fruit made their death imminent.


18) amidst all the good of creation we now have the _not good_ of loneliness.
It's also interesting that God considers Adam alone because he does not have a spouse.
Yet, God made Adam wait for her...

19) God brings the beasts to Adam (likewise to Noah, later.)
The animals names stuck- the creator is hands-off in the usage of creation.

20) Every creature of sky and land was named by Adam- imagine the duration...
No animal is a fit helper for man- that is, none can be a perfect match.

21-22) Crucifixion parallel?  At His death Jesus side was opened by a Roman spear.
We receive life from the water & blood.

21) Adam is put to sleep; so is Abraham during his covenant exposure in Genesis 15.
The sleep is necessary for two reasons:
1. God does surgery on Adam.
2. God alone makes the helper- this emphasizes that she was not derived by man but from him.

rib ~ selah, it is a bone from the side, also used of structural member (a beam or plank.)

God made Eve and God brought Eve to Adam.


23) bone/flesh ~ Adam understood the sameness of Eve and her distinctiveness

As His bride how does the Church manifest 'bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh'?
# Genesis 26


19+) Two nations in a womb
  Esau ~ "hairy", red & strong
  Jacob ~ "supplanter", heel-grabber# Genesis 27


Interesting that there are so many redundant words in this narrative, in the hebrew:
- hand hand
- blessed blessed
- escape escape

There is a dualism about Jacob's entire life:
- a twin
- a second son
- two wives
- Jacob/Israel# Genesis 28


22) The first occurrence of "tithe"
# Genesis 3

## Genesis 3:1-19

* History
  * the origin story of all people of God
  * written to the diasporic from Egypt
  * the story is fraught with broken cultural paradigms of the place of the man/woman
* Theology
  * Sin brings consequences.
  * Separation from God is bad.
  * Man is separated from the tree of life, otherwise he would eat of it and live forever in a fallen state.
  * Eve is not cursed- the seed of the woman is the only hope humans have.
* Literature
  * narrative w/ dialog, the story 
  * legal, the judgment given by God
* Words
  * serpent = NK$, the shining one; only serpentine in the broader theological sense like dragon and leviathan- the chaos gods
  * GN LRCH Y'M ~ garden's spirit/wind of-the-day;  at the wind of the day = there was already a prescribed meeting time with God


1. Why wasn't Eve startled or unsettled by the nachash?
  ...probably because it was not unknown to her, maybe because she had confidence in some measure of Godly protection
  ...NK$ is a title, much like S+N and diabolos
  YRVM ~ shrewdness, craftiness; not an inherently negative trait
  We are called the be shrewd by Jesus: [Matthew 10:16]()
  The serpent twists the command:
    "any"~ NK$ is twisting the command of God

2. Adam had added to God's command when he gave it Eve: "or touch it"; 
  ...thus making it more difficult and more likely to be challenged

3. God did not actually prohibit touching the tree; Adam & Eve added this prohibition.
  This kind of extrapolation was to become a typical Jewish perogative.
  ...we should avoid adding our own interpretive conclusions to Scripture.
  ...this doubtful dismissal of God's word is the preeminent human failure

4. An outright lie- it is his nature to contradict God
  NK$ plants a seed of doubt, the human acts on it- in ways far grander than the initial temptation.
  The serpents advantage is that he knows the resultant death is not immediate.
  So, Adam watches Eve eat and not die immediately and then partakes.


6. She perceived some benefits of the fruit, but they didn't have the foresight to see the actual outcome
"her husband, who was with her"- Adam observed the interaction with NK$ and was silent!
Eve was deceived, Adam was guilty.
  - this is why the immaculate conception of Jesus is important: He does not inherit Adamic guilt, he is of the seed of the woman alone

7. "eyes...were opened" is a euphemism; might it also be literal?
  i.e. a physiological change which removed some protection from them
  some traditions speak of Adam&Eve being "clothed in light" which may allude to a condition of graceful protection they were in
  Nakedness then becomes unacceptable to them...contrast to [Gen 2:25]()

8. Yahweh Elohim, name explicitly
  "at the time of the evening breeze"

9. God called Adam ~ any doubt who was responsible?


11. "Who told you that you were naked?"
  They were naked before; it is just now that they are ashamed of it.

12. Adam let Eve take the lead with NK$; now he passes blame to her

13. Eve blames the deceiver but she and Adam were the ones who actually performed the sinful act.

14, 17. Two cursed things: the serpent and the land

15. Protovangelion ~ first good news
Man attacks first, then the NK$
attack/bruise ~ shuwph ~ an expansive, crushing blow
  - Job 9:17
  - PS 139:11


16-19. The commandment is God, to be fruitful and multiply, is now made exceedingly difficult as a consequence of The Fall.


16. the pain is not just physical but the emotional distress of worry and uncertainty

The woman wants to control the man.  The man wants to dominate the woman.
The ideal is implied by contrast: a complementary submission based on God-given roles.


19. Adam was taken "from dust"; doubly: made from carbon-based substance and from the ground, the barren, chaotic earth, into the garden.


## Genesis 3:20-24
* History
  * Written to diasporic Hebrew nomads in the Sinai desert
  * Written by a Hebrew orphan raised as Egyptian nobility
  * This is codification of an oral, traditional story
* Literature
  * This section is a narration of God's program immediately after doling out consequences from The Fall
* Lexicography
  * KVH ~ Eve; is first named here: `life` is in her and hope for redemption.
  * YVR ~ skin/hide; 
  * TVB, RY ~ good, evil; counterplay of cosmic programs
  * ADMH ~ Adamah; ground, from when ADM came, he works it, then he decays back into it
  * V'BR$ ~ drove-out; literally forcing out, exile, sometimes in the context of divorce: rejecting a woman and sending her away.
* Theology
  * This passage lays the groundwork for future reconciliation with God.
  * The Fall has massive consequences that will take millenia to resolve but Adam & Eve couldn't know that.
  * We also see the divine council in play here.
  * The flaming, whirling sword is an icon of God's conquering justice.


20. Adam's responded to his wife by naming her (and later reproduced with her)
    * Adam renames his wife _after_ the curse signifying that he associates redemption with her childbearing.


21. Yahweh gets skins from somewhere, obviously animals had to die.
    * We know that, later, humans had a program of sacrifice so it seems likely that God initiated it...perhaps here.
    * This is the patterning of ritual sacrifice: one thing dies to _cover_ another.


22. 'us' = divine council
    * To be divine is to know things beyond the natural; i.e. good & evil.
'put forth his hand'

    * Now that humans had broken **the** rule it was likely they would break more.
      ...So, God separates them from eternal, physical life.
    * If they had been allowed to attain eternal, physical life they would have lived forever in the fallen state.


23. God drives humans out of paradise to work the ground; they must know cause the ground to yield fruit- it no longer does so naturally.


24. Yahhweh **drove** them out ~ ekbalo
    * [Mark 1:] the Spirit drove Jesus (after the baptism)
    * The entrance to Eden is in the East-
      * East always symbolizes foreboding, it is also the vast unknown landscape: to the ANE inhabitant it seemed that there was land to the east indefinitely...
    * Cherubims guard the entrance; these are the most powerful created beings, this is a serious level of guarding which is meant to prevent the greatest possible catastrophe: man living forever in his fallen state.
    * The flaming sword represents judgmental word of God
      * Fire is judgment and consumption; fire is unceremonious and unbigoted.
      * Later on the sword is God's word; He always fights His battles with this weapon because what He says comes to pass...He can operate the universe via voice command.
      * "keep the way of the tree of life"  God keeps [L$MR] the way, guards it, preserves it.  There will be a plan enacted to give humans eternal life again but it must be after their redemption from their sinful state.
# Genesis 31


13) Yahweh is the God of Bethel ~ [Gen 28:10+]
Genesis 4


# Cain and Abel

History
God has promised a redeemer and here is a brand-new man from Eve's womb.
There was obviously a system of worship in place, and Cain and Abel were both aware of it.
There were other humans outside of Adam's realm, because Cain mentions them and is afraid of them.
This instantiates the idea of the "marked": those who are exiled from the exiles.
God's people are separate from the rest, but some are separated again.

Culture
This becomes a story about devotion to the Lord.
It is also an analysis of the shallowness of sinful thought: Cain does not retaliate against God but against Abel.
More, famous rhetorical questions from God.
We have the pattern established of the wanderer.

Literary style
Short narrative then expository dialogue.

Lexical
Sex & birth ~ first mention
V+HR ~ and she conceived; 
HBL ~ Abel; breath
Q'N ~ Cain; possession
$MR ~ Guardian; 

Theology



The murderous rivalry between siblings increases from here on
- Cain & Abel
- Moses & Ramses
- Moses & Aaron
- Jacob's sons


2) Jobs
   - Abel was a shepherd
   - Cain was a farmer
   - The role of each is part of their identity, but the consequences are not related to their vocation/role
   - shepherds were always considered a lower class
   - farmers were a higher-class, more refined
     - one of the lynchpins of empire is the advent of farming technique modernization

3-4) Cain brought an offering, Abel brought a sacrifice
  - [Matt ?:?]() The widow brought 2 mites and was exalted by Jesus for giving a sacrificial offering


6-8) God dialogues with Cain but not with Abel
     - Abel's heart is right and there is no need for the __sanctifying talk__
     - Cain is in need of redemption and God attempts to bring him back to the fold

7) This event likely occurs at a "high place", there is a door to Eden which is blocked by angels
   - the door is valid as a metaphor but is also, literally, at the door of the garden of Eden; i.e. the mountain of God



## Cain's Lineage; vv.15+

- HISTORY: Antediluvian, post-Eden people who chose not to be in God's preisthood
- CULTURE: This story sets up the pattern of the dispossessed son who lives at odds with God
- LITERATURE: We have a genealogical narrative establishing two lines
- MEANING:
  - sevenfold, seventy-fold are ways of saying "throw the book at" or __all of the law__
  - names have meaning and tell part of the story
- THEOLOGY:
  - there are two choices are play here: God's choice to redeem and man's choice to accept or reject


15) We don't know what the mark of Cain is but it was surely something that all people [of the day] would recognize.  
    It could have been a known symbol: God seems to still interact with people even though they are exiled from the garden.
    It could have been a demeanor: the redeemed person carries themselves in a particular way.
  Sevenfold is a way of saying "throw the book at him"; i.e. the full extent of the law.

16) Cain left the presence of God to the land of wanderers in the east
    East is always a place of foreboding and exile.
    Nod means wanderers; perhaps a geography, perhaps a sub-culture.

17) Cain has a son, Enoch (who will later walk with God)
    Where did Cain's wife come from?
    - his sister?
    - other people already outside of Eden?
  The city is a construct meant for defense in case of war.
  - Cain is afraid, and is no longer in God's presence, so he builds a construct meant to protect him from the world.
  - Enoch means dedicated; the city is like a memorial- quite a congnitive conundrum; the self-consequenced exile constructing a memorial wall against humanity. 
  - quite the anithesis of redeemed/saved who stay at the face of God

18) Cain's lineage:
    - Enoch; dedicated
    - Irad; fleet, wild-ass
    - Mehujael; smitten, proclaimer
    - Methushael; of-God, demands-death
    - Lamech; powerful, made-low


19,23) Lamech goes for more: 2 wives and an order-of-magnitude more punishment for his murder

19) Adah; ornament
    Zillah; shade

20-22) Lamech+Adah -> 
    - Jabal; stream-of-water
      - he is the original shepherd
    - Jubal; stream
      - the original musician
    Lamech+Zillah ->
    - Tubal-Cain; brought-of-Cain, worldy-possession
      - the original smithy
    - Naamah; loveliness

    There is at least an intellectual link here with the descendant watchers
    - the fallen ones taught women how to seduce men with makeup and ornaments
    - they also taught men how to make weapons of war
    - curiously, there is no-one linking the __pharmakeia__ aspect of the watcher's teaching

23-24) Lamech kills a boy, not a man, for [seemingly] more than Abel was killed for: physically wounding him
       - he claims a fuller privilege of protection
       - surely this is a misappropriation of God's judgment upon Cain and a mis-understanding of God's working

25) Adam+Eve -> Seth; puts-right
    - the replacement

26) Seth -> Enosh
    - man; mortal
  QRA ~ men __called__ upon the name of Yahweh
  - this could be preaching the good news, hopefulness
  - e.g. Abraham QRA Yahweh as a form of ministry to his tribe [Gen 13:4]()# Genesis 47


31) Jacob leaned on his bed/staff and worshipped
  This is the first use of the word worship:
    it isn't thru song or sermon but through an introspective recount of Providence's work in his life
    the traditional interpretation is "staff" from MTH, this is promoted by the Hebrews 11:21 recounting, it literally means "bed" but is a pun which can be taken either way, the theological fundament is the same.# Genesis 48


15-16) Yahweh as "the angel"
# Genesis 7


The animals came in pairs, as they did to Adam.
Noah is typical of Adam and the Ark is a micro-Eden.

Was the flood global?
  There are many flood myths around the world.
  There is also evidence around the globe of a cataclysm like this.
  # Younger-Dryess event
  # Every ancient culture has a major flood myth which are roughly coincident with the Biblical account 
  The biblical authors were but aware of the the globe not all it's continents.

  ...it does not make a difference theologically.  What matters is the reboot and redemption brought via ablution.


Clean/Unclean
- Noah had this notion at least as far as acceptability of sacrifice, perhaps also as nutrition and usefulness


## What is a flood?
- mb'l ~ deluge, celestial sea, flowing waters
- in those case it is a mixing of the 3 tiers of creation: deeps, land, and heaven
~ In Psalm 29 God is enthroned on the mb'l, the celestial sea
...Yahweh is the King of Mabul; the King of what they feared the most- the chaotic waters.
  - they feared to sail out of sight of the shore
  - they were dependent upon rain and springs for crops/food
- [Gen 30:20]() ~ God opened Rachel's womb and children came forth from the waters of birth


## The divided waters

The great-deep and the sky; the waters were divided thus during creation.
Ancient people did not know about the water cycle.
Their knew that there were "springs"- waters in the ground- and waters above; i.e. clouds brought rain from above.
They believed that God held the waters in their place; this is literally, indirectly true: the laws of nature hold these things in place.
So, though we do not live in a dome, scripture can still be applied in the context of our understanding because it does not precisely contradict the nature of creation.

It was when God released His hand (He withdrew the restraints on the waters) that the water crashed forth.
...the deep and the heavens came together- a cosmic collpase of heaven and earth; i.e. decreation.


## De-Creation / Re-Creation

All land-flesh were destroyed.
The land itself and the fish were not destroyed.
The initiation of the de-creation was a baptism that didn't wash away but, rather, destroyed.
The remnant was alone, floating amidst the chaotic waters.
When the flood was over the remnant had to wait even longer for the waters' recession.
The recreation was the drying of the land and the seeding of new life.

- the waters were GBR "mighty"
  - the Nephilim were also GBR but the waters prevailed over them
  - the water prevailed over the mountains ~ mountains were the abode of gods


## Fifteen

The waters were 15 cubits deep, the Ark was 30 cubits high
15 is indicative of redemptive rest
- Hezekiah was granted an extra 15 years
- Passover is Nisan 15th
- 15 x 10 days of waters prevailing over the earth: perfect de-creation, redemption, then rest

# Genesis 8


## Ararat
~ the curse of trembling
The Ark was lifted to the mountaintop, from the man descends to re-populate the earth.


## Wind 
~ RVK
- the parting of the Red Sea hearkens back to this


## Remember
~ XCR
- God does not forget, He recalls the to the present
- Remembering is bringing things to the present in the context of human existence
- Or, recalling to the forefront a thing whose time has come
- We remember when prompted by an association; God remembers when He brings forward
  - a modern analogy: a computer does not forget data, it is stored and is recalled when the program is loaded; God's events are like a timed event which runs the program which recalls the data
- Memory and remembrance is only significant in the human paradigm; i.e. within time.  It is not a valid concept in the divine realm.
# Genesis 9

1) "Be fruitful and multiply" ~ continuing the Adamic typology
2) Fear of man
   - same creature order as Genesis 1
   - reiteration man's dominion
   - the 2nd mention of fear, the first is when fallen man encounters God for the 1st time
3) animals are now provisioned for food
   - in addition to plants
   - [Genesis 1:29]()
4) the prohibition against blood is a remembrance of God's sovereignty in giving the life, the provision of meat
   - the life belongs to God
   - it is also a healthful thing, to avoid pathogens
   - Moses is writing this setup the laws which come later
5-6) blood is required to atone for murder, including that done by animals
     - because men are imagers of God
     - the murderous rivalry between siblings increases from here on

  This enmity between man, God, and nature is reversed in the new Eden, via the messiah: [Isaiah 11]()

7) Another reiteration of the procreation mandate: this is obviously important
8-16) God establishes a covenant
   - with Noah, his sons, and their offspring; i.e. all people
   - AND with every living creature from the Ark
- The substance of the covenant
  - never again destruction via water
- The sign of the covenant: the rainbow

17) Noah confirms/recognizes the covenant and its sign
18) Foreshadowing that Canaan is a pivotal character
19) The pattern of diaspora continues;
God disperses people as a punishment, though temporary because there is always a plan to reunite.
The seas/waters are often symbolic of mankind; their dispersion is indicative of divine punishment akin to the deluge.
20-27) There are idioms and verbage here which indicates some sexual act.
Noah's laying uncovered may imply a sexual act [with his wife]
Canaan is cursed, not Ham.
- because Canaan was an illegitimate offspring
It is a recurring theme that a son sleeps with his father's wife as a means to overrun him.

"See the nakedness" is only powerful as an idiom (it's mostly unavoidable in normal family life):
	[Lev 20:11,17] ~ this exposits the idiom - it implies sexual intercourse
	[Ez 16:35-37]
	[Ez 23:10+]

	[Lev 18:6-18] ~ the key here is v.7,10,14 which exposits that the "nakedness" of the man is his wife;

	this means that Ham attempted to usurp Noah's position via incest with his mother
	...the offspring of the incest, Canaan, was thus cursed

	Shem and Japheth, by walking backwards and covering mom, do a good thing and refuse to go the route of Ham.

	There is also an allusion to the seeds of woman and serpent:
		~ Japheth & Canaan respectively

25-27) This poem is the key to all struggles that will ensue in coming generations
- Shem, the seed of the woman
  - Japheth, the servents of Shem
    - Ham, the servant of servants
- ...
  - Japheth; Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, Tiras
  ~ enlarged; complete, covering, deceiver, earth(confusion), drawn-by-force, desirable
    - Ham; Cush, Mizraim, Put, Canaan
    ~ hot; blackness, tribulations, to-give, merchant(subduer)
    ! Nimrod, beginning of Babylon, land of Shinar
    
27) "in the tents of"
    - possibilities: brothers dwell together; a servant dwells in the master's tent; a conqueror takes over the conquered's tent
    - both of these come into play in future struggles between these families
 	
# Haggai 1

# Haggai 2


9) the latter Temple could also be the temple of [1 Cor 3:16]() ~ the believer, in whom is peace


12-13) Holiness is not contagious but disease is.  Holiness is imbued by another.
i.e. you can be dragged down incidentally bit sanctification comes after following a process that you chose.


# Hebrews 1

1) "Long ago", in the beginning
 ~ [Gen 1:1], [John 1:1]
"many ways" ~ The diversity of genre within the revelation only serves to enhance its singular message: the gospel of Christ.

2) "these last days" ~ could mean the dawn of new era, the early Church believed that they were in the beginning of the end of time

"by a Son" ~ this does not mean polytheism, it simply refers to the fact that Jesus was/is a spiritual being (this does not mean He is not the Almighty, in fact it implies that He is superior: Yahweh reveals through both spiritual and physical incarnations - He is both within and above these)

3) "exact imprint" ~ whereas the Shekinah was a limited expression
"...of his nature" ~ charakter ~ character
upholds ~ _pharo_, the idea of maintenance or sustenance
...[Col 1:17]
	**all things**

	"sat down" this Son (pre-eminent above all others) is _with_ God
...note the notion of finality in the Son's act

	5 attributes of the Son
	- the radiance of His glory
	- the exact representation of His essence
	- the sustainer of His word of power
	- provider of purification of sins
	- occupant of the divine throne
	* these are not the inheritance, they are identifiers which give this Son status

	radiance, _apaugasma_ ~ occurs only one other time inthe Septuagint: Wisdom of Solomon referring to [WOS 7:24+], [Prov 8] Lady Wisdom.
	"Lady" is grammatical, not biological
	[Luke 11:49-51] alludes to Wisdom of Solomon [7:27]; Jesus' statement equates the Father and Wisdom.
	It is not Torah which is superior but Christ.

2,4) "heir" ~ is not a statement of ontology (beginnings) or instantiation.
Neither does it imply succession or replacement.


6) firstborn

[Ex 4:22] ~ "Israel is my firstborn son", firstborn is status not chronology

the firstborn human is actually Adam

[Col 1:15] ...of all creation
[Col 1:18] ...from the dead
[Rom 8:29] ...among many brothers

Christ has status/qualitative priority - not chronological

[Ps 2:7]() [Acts 13:33]() ~ equates the resurrection with firstbornage

[Heb 5:5]() ~ equates firstbornage with appointment (i.e. status)
...this is an inauguration of Jesus' kingship



[Deut 32:43]() ~ this verse is quoted here and comes from the Dead Sea scrolls
- so, the author of Hebrews had access to that text

# Hebrews 11


How do the following apply to the members of the Hall-of-Faith?
-	 suffering
- 	moral failure
- doubt


The _faith_ here is of a future Messiah
...we know this Messiah but have a further faith: that He is coming back


Abel

Enoch
	pleasing = drawing near = relationship
	[Rom 8:7-8], []

Abhraham
	surely he doubted...but he followed loyally

Isaac

Joseph

"The People"

Rahab

Gideon
	doubter

Barak

Samson

Jephthah

David

Samuel
	[1Sam 16]

"The Prophets"


The actors action illustrates the loyal belief.# Hebrews 12

1) "the entangling sin" is unbelief; based on the opening _Therefore_ and the main topic of the book - unbelief...


5-6) [PROV 3:11,12]
 i.e. [Eph 3:20], [JMS 1:1], [ROM 5:3-4]



12) Again, the language of endurance - not moral improvement

[Heb 3:1]

"root of bitterness" ~ Mara; bitterness springing from suffering


14) on the heels of a treatise on recognizing and receiving discipline, he admonishes to make peace.
  strive for peace, yearn and work for it - it either comes by cleansing within or without, by clearing the heart or removing one self
  also, pursue holiness, this requires all the aforementioned effects of discipline

18-19) Mount Sinai imagery [Ex 19,20]

18) [Ex 19:18] [Ex 20:18]

19) [Ex 19:16]


22-24) A divine council setting, a non-earthly, non-physical reality
Hebrews 13

The Leadership Manual


1) God desires unity {Ps 133}
To the 1st century person, including outsiders into a family unit was a foreign idea.

2) be hospitable, you may never know the good that it brings

3) we believers mentally share each other's suffering

4) the admonition against these sins is always valid
But, in this context it is especially against those with divided loyalties (to the world)

5) don't cover, because you don't need it.
Good will provide all of your needs.

6) Yahweh can deliver me from anything

7) Pay attention to your Church leaders.
Remember them = investments of time, prayer, gifts

Imitate their faith ~ you must first decide if they have faith; if not there is nothing to imitate _spiritually_.  They may very well have advice and interesting stories but it is a waste of time seeking spiritual guidance from non-spiritual people (and not all believers are particularly spiritual.)

Consider the outcome of their way of life - we **shall be** fruit inspectors.  You may consider their wealth: physical and social; consider their station: respect, reputation, etc.; consider their demeanor: occurrences of anger, treatment of other via gossip, correspondence, and face-to-face encounters.

It comes down to gleaning: grab the good stuff, leave the bad, and vacate when there is not enough nourishment from the fruit (it is not worth your time.)

8) Remember Yeshua, the unchanging, the ultimate example.
He is perfectly good and steadfast.

9. Don't be swayed by wasteful endeavors.
Learn from others' experiences - don't waste your time on idolatrous things.
It is a grace to be aware of the failures of others...that we might not fall similarly.

10. The implication is that there are some serving who are not saved.
# Hebrews 2

1) "drift away" ... from the knowledge of the superior revelation [and work] of Christ


3) neglect ~ apathy or default (as in not keeping a promise)


5-18) The object of Christ's redemptive work is humanity.


9) Angels is used as a generic term for inhabitants of the spiritual realm who are loyal to Yahweh.  Interestingly, _theos_ is sometimes used in the manner (which refers to a kind rather than a role).


14) Jesus is human because humans are the intended object of redemption.
[Gal 3:26-29]



17) Jesus' sacrifice was "to make propitiation for the sins of the **people**"; not for angels or anyone/thing else.
[Rev 1-3] ~ "he who has an ear...to the churches" the angel is a conduit
[1Cor 6:3]
[Col 1:19-20] [Col 2:15] ~ refers to completed act
	[2Cor 5:19] & [John 3:16] are eschatological

Not only are we to rule with Him but don't forget that it is necessary for humans to inherit the rule because _Jesus is human_.
# Hebrews 3


5) servant = therapon


12) note that he is addressing "brothers" in fretting about unbelief

13) encouragement is the antidote to hardheartedness
# Hebrews 4


1) "the promise...still stands" this validates the basis of the book: that which cannot be gained by moral perfection cannot be lost by moral imperfection.
The promise = belief brings salvation.


3) The theme of the book: "we who believe enter that rest"

Hebrews 8

The new covenant is [Jer 31:34] bound to knowing Yahweh.



5) [Col 2:17]


8b-12) Quotes [Jer 31:31-34]; a large quotation like this is significant and illuminates the importance of the concept: Jesus trumps Torah.


13) [Jer 31:31] is the prediction of the new covenant
[2Cor 3:7+] details this passing of the old system

# Hebrews 9

4) In OT the altar of incense was not in the holy of holies.
...however, this fact corresponds with the Samaritan Pentateuch which has a recension in [Ex 31].

5) Mercy Seat ~ Hylasterion; the important idea is that access has been **permanently** secured by Jesus' sacrifice (as opposed to the OT system where annual refreshment was required).

6-7) There are multiple obstacles to humanity approaching God:
- priesthood
- performing duties
- veil/curtain
- annual visit
- blood required

8) "indicates" this is a present, ongoing condition - Him declaring.


[Gal 3:15-17]
Hebrews


Probably not written by Paul, the style+vocab forensics don't support it.
the author was male [11:32] and knew Timothy: perhaps it was Apollos.

The book was written to a group of disillusioned gifted.

Hebrews was probably written around 60AD

1) Similarly: we were loved and then called out of the world

2) Reciprocal to His calling they went after other gods

3) How could they not know their healer?  Perhaps because it was vicarious and we choose to dismiss supernatural influencers...

4) "cords of kindness" "bands of love" ~ these are bindings, not frivolity
"I became to them as" a simile concerning God's interplay and revelation
...again a vicarious treatment: easing the yoke is a physical act, as is bending down, and feeding; not to mention the literal fulfillment of these things via Christ

5) {Matt 2:15}
Hosea 13


1)	Ephraim = fruitful
	Israel = prevails w/ God
	When the fruitful spoke, there was trembling and God was exalted
	...but Baalism incurred guilt
	...leading to death
2)	sin increases

9)	destroys Israel

10)	mockery from God
		they begged for a king
		the king cannot save them
	"...a king and princes"
		Melech ~ king (1 of these, David)
		Sarim ~ prince (many of these)
11)	God gave a king in anger
	...and took it away
12)	inquity of Fruitful
	...stored up for later (?)
		sin must be dealt with - it cannot be ignored
		implies it lingers...supernaturally
13)	pangs of childbirth (foreshadowing suffering)
		but the unwise don't perceive it
		...they _can't_ discern
	the unwise is not in the right place at the right time
Hosea 14


2) Can we possibly repay Him?  Here He asks for payment: "the fruit of our lips".


4) the restoration of Israel
Hosea
= Yahweh savior/safety
~ same root as Hosanna

ministered latter half of 8th c. BC
	turmoil
	6 kings in 30 years

Baalism
	Baal-peor
	Baal-gad
	sex,drunkenness,bestiality,human sacrifice,mutilations,incest
	= various expiations of ritual prostitution
	...intimacy with ungods

much of the book is Elohim speaking in 1st person

book is poetic and formatted like an indictment


Another Hosea ~ {Num 13:8,16}


Israeli national restoration
  {Matt 23:37-39}
Similtudes ~ allegories & puns ~ models


Hosea 5


!) 'I will go and return to my place' = Jesus' ascension, He will stay until the Jews repent from rejecting Him
		{Matt 12} ~ the rejection and the curse
	Israel will seek Him because of afflication (war)

From {1:18} ... "Come!"

	He also establishes His dominion

	throne = heaven
	footstool = earth

	He has no need for us to build Him a domicile - He builds it Hisself
	He has no need of rest, therefore there is no such place
		however, Jesus did rest ~ does He still?

2) His 'hand' has made all things ~ ?the memra?  ?wisdom?  is His hand?
	But - why this connector?  implies that in spite of the preceding declaration He takes an interest in man
		and not any men in particular, but looks/טבנ (behold/regard favorably) on those who:
		- are humble/ינע in spirit/חור
			poor, afflicted ~ spiritually
		- are contrite/הכנ in spirit/חור
			stricken, maimed, smitten, dejected ~ spiritually
		- tremble at His word
			fear not earthly powers, fear the One who moves them
			reverential fear

	So, do we take this to mean our acceptance of our hopeless finality?  The man who is looked upon by God is a spiritual waste.

3) the one who practices false religion is absolutely disgusting to God

4) apostates choose their own destruction by their fears
Isaiah 1


3) i.e. the dumbest creatures on earth know who I am but my own [human] children do not


24) the trinity
	Lord
	Lord of Hosts
	Mighty One of Israel
Isaiah 10

Satan's authority ~ {Luke 4}

Spiritual warfare ~ {Daniel 9} (fast, Prince of Persia struggle)

{Eph 6}

	it is the LORD's doing, His armor
	flaming darts = accussations


4) mashal ~ comparative parable


9) The dead are interactive.


21) Urbanity is a symbol of control of the land.  Some translations say "their cities" implying that there is a distinction.  Could also be urbanism insofar as it contradicts nature.

Isaiah 18


_beyond_ Ethiopia
	Isaiah 19


9-11) The Aswan Dam = ecological disaster
	Zoan = Tanis

	{Jer 32:20}

Isaiah 24


5) everlasting covenant [Gen 8:22]

6) earth-dwellers ({Rev})

18) echoes of {Gen 6}

21) all the kings of the earth?  
		{Ps 2}
		this implies recognition of God as...something
	enemies of the state are punished where they abide

22) Tartaras
	{2Pet 2:4}

Isaiah 25


7) a veil, blindness, over all nations
	the veil is sucked up _on the mountain_Isaiah 26


9) my soul yearns...
		layil ~ in the night

19) earth gives birth to the dead
	{1Th 4:16} 'the dead in Christ will rise first'

20) come my people
	{1Th 4:15+}
		1st the dead rise
		all rise together
	{Rev 4:5} ~ the lampstands are in heaven
	1. enter your room {Jn 14:2}
	2. shut the door
	3. hide yourselves 
	...until the fury passes
	{Zeph 2:3} ~ perhaps _you_ may be hidden in the tribulation
		you = the righteous & humble
	These 3 elements reflect Noah's flood remnant
     They may also foreshadow a rapture- a hiding of God's people during the tribulation

21) the coming conqueror
Isaiah 27


Isaiah 28


The False Religious Leaders

7) drunkards

9) spiritual growth ~ weaning

10) Scripture is holographic
	doctrine is also spread throughout the Bible
	a hologram is fuzzy and ugly in normal light
		in the light [laser] that created it the image is sharp and 3D
	Scripture is reflexive and recursive

18) God overturns the peace treaty with world government
Isaiah 29


13) Reading is rote, not careful or substantive
yare' ~ fear/reverence, ?worship?


16) modern man rejects the very thought of a sovereign creator

Isaiah 3


4) the children are running things
	~ this is a sign of decline

Isaiah 30

1-2) we _all_ seek the worldly answer for security

3) God will undo our reliance on the world

18) the LORD is waiting on you to be humble
	{Jam 4:6} ~ God gives grace to the humble
	"Don't let the tyranny of self-sufficiency rob you of the miraculous"
	waiting = blessing {Is 40:31} {Ps 27:14}

26) may imply a correction of the laws of nature
Isaiah 34


4) skies roll up _like a scroll_
		higher dimensions are said to be _rolled up_ within branes

1) seven women
	[Rev 2:3] seven churches
	[Matth ?] seven kingdom parables
	[] seven Pauline ecclesiastical letters
	'one man'
	their own apparel ~ righteousness
		good luck with that at the judgment
		[Matt 22:1-14]
Isaiah 40


12) interesting: the quantitative measure of the stuff of creation

13) comparison with the omnipresence of the LORD


22) the circle of the earth ~ far precedes the scientific verification of the shape of the earth and opposes all other such thought of that day


31) _renew_ strength ~ implies a long journey and the means to cover a distance
	it is not nearly as hard to die for the LORD as it is to live for Him
Isaiah 41


10) 
God's decree, I will:
- strengthen
- help
- uphold

_My_ right hand ~ hallelujah! ours is impossibly weak to do this work
Isaiah 43

1) we are called by name ~ personally, provincially
"you are mine" paid in full [John 19:30]

2) "_When_ you pass through" ~ not if,
flood and fire are guaranteed
however, strength to stand up in the waters and immunity to the fire are also guaranteed


7) created, formed, and made
Isaiah 44


20) {Zech 11:17}
# Isaiah 49


6) Israel's salvation is only the beginning


11) Yahweh turns obstacles into opportunities.
Furthermore He paves the way for a gospel blitzkrieg.


16) How is this not the risen Savior proclamation.
He always has His people on His mind.


23) this is an earthly promise as well as a Bema seat one
  the first part of the verse is mostly Jewish, but there are tones for the church here
  surely, none of us will be ashamed before God, under the blood of Christ, but neither will we be ashamed _here_: wickedness will not become good, impropriety will not become righteousness
Isaiah 5

- idolizing debauchery


26+) the coming of the Assyrians
Isaiah 55


8-9) God does not require our input into His plans
  ...yet His plans are for our benefit
  ...we need to appreciate His plans' inclusivity
Isaiah 63


2-3) God is covered enemies' blood head to toe.
He does this _alone_, He needs no assistance fighting His battles.

Isaiah


"The Holy One of Israel"


There is scholarly contention regarding the authorship of The Book of Isaiah.
The traditional view is that Isaiah wrote the book in exactly the form that we have it now.
Liberal scholarship attributes sections of Isaiah to other authors.
The truth is probably in the middle: Isaiah originally wrote the content but it was compiled and edited by exilic scholars.
The editorial view applies to most of the OT...and does not undermine inspiration.

Traditional authorship defense:
1) NT authors quote Isaiah-II by name
	[Matt 3:3] -> [Is 40:3-5]
	[Mark 10:16]
	[Matt 12:18-21] -> [Is 42]
	[Rom 10:16] -> [Is 53]
	[Matt 8:17] -> [Is 53:4]
2) Isaiah contains predictive prophecy:
	[Is 44:8], [Is 45:1] ~ Cyrus
	[Is 13-15] ~ Babylon was not a world power at that time
3) There are literary elements that lend themselves to a single author.
4) There is first-hand content from Isaiah's lifetime in the book.

The Little Apocalypse

{Isaiah 24-27}
# James 1

4) The fact that endurance effects us implies a long-term scenario.
It is implied that we can opt-out of this process (and lose the benefit.)
"mature and complete" while we can expect progress, ultimate maturity and completeness


9-11) gospel perspective


12) Here we also see the tenses of salvation:
- been saved: the loved one, held by God
- being saved: steadfastness
- be saved: crown of life

It is not "Christian"to simply endure temptations and trial


18) we ought to be childlike, rather than childish, in our approach to Yahweh


27) "unstained"? not changed/altered by worldliness
"whatever you do to the least of these" [Matt 25:40]
Works ~ [Matt 25:34+]()


1) This can be extrapolated to account for spiritual riches as well - didn't Jesus apply Hisself to our benefit when we were unknowing, unknown, and poor in spirit?


9)
Note that he is drawing a parallel between hatred and favortism:
-> favoring one person over another is the same as hating one person and not another

The answer is to favour all people - all humans shall be shown dignity, all should be treated as believers or as having a chance for such

10) The Law is one thing - the intent/theme of the various regulations and decrees
	[Gal 5:3]

	The Law is contextual - it is meant to be applied in the context in which it is received
	[1Cor 7:17-20]
	[Heb 9:8-10]

	"The Law" is also presented as a dichotomy to help explain faith & works:
	- The Law ~ refers to the entire composition of scripture and of individual elements in it
- mercy shown to the merciful ~ not a prerequisite work but a condition
	- Faith is Works is Faith ~ i.e. good deeds are evidence of faith which produces good deeds
	- e.g. Hebrews ~ there is similar dichotomy built-up between faith & salvation also
	- There are not [finally] resolvable; you may occassionally resolve such a concept in a finite context but not in general.


12-13) Two Judgments
- by the Law
+ by mercy
Two Seats
[2Cor 5:10]
[Rom 14:10-12]
[1Cor 3:10-15]

13) This harkens back to the Lord's prayer: forgive...as we forgive

14) 


19) faith ~ persuaded


21) "able to save" then why doesn't it?  Because you don't study it, read it, or partake at all.


25) perseveres/continues in it (the Word) ~ _eleutheria parameno_ i.e. abides in the law of liberty
James 4

2) "Kill"?  This is a profound evil among any group, especially the church.
[Matt 5:22]
[1Jon 3:15]


5) Perhaps not a quotation, because it <ahem> does not with any OT passage:
	"Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture _speaks_?  He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us."


8) Double-Minded
indecisiveness and ineffectiveness is a result being unrested and unclean
	
	
12) [2Tim 3:16] scripture must be used as the interface between conflicters


17) It is such a fine line between the evil of murder in the heart and not doing a good, necessary thing.
"The right thing" is that which the LORD wills [v.15]
# James 5


13-18) No prayer means no relationship ~ with God or others.

16)
The effectiveness of a prayer is based on our proximity to God.
When we live in license, atop God's grace, we remove ourselves from the kingdom workflow.
...rejection of His deliverance (by continued sin) is training the mind to disbelieve since we were not, in the end, saved


Jeremiah 17


8) [Ps 1], there is no good act given here - blessing depends on where you are planted, not a reward but a consequence of the dirt you're in.
4-7) Thriving: Purdue the well-being of the city you are in
1. God put you there
2. It's a benefit to you
3. It's God's plan

4) Thus says Yahweh:
"He has exiled" deliberate/intentional
Jeremiah 33


1)	Word to Jeremiah a 2nd time
	...partnership
	...while he was shut up
2)	LORD
	creator
	LORD
3)	call...He will answer
	tell you
		great things (to you)
		hidden things (from you)
		unknown things (by you)
		...nothing is great, hidden/unknown to Him
Jeremiah 1


9) A theophany ~ "the LORD _put out His hand_"
Jeremiah 10


1) O, Christmas Tree!
# Jeremiah 2

The leaders not only forgot God but used religious traditions and issue for personal gain.

Like the manna, we are not to store God's living water.
Stored glory leaks away;
it stagnates;
it doesn't last, much of it leaks off;
the container is open to foreign waters.
# Jeremiah 31


covenant with both houses: Israel & Judah
law within, in their hearts
master & loyal follower (ownership language)


31) Genesis of the new covenant.
Jeremiah 32


20) signs and wonders in EgyptJob 1


The Satan is not necessarily a devil and refers to a role rather than an individual.  It means "adversary" as in, accuser... think: opposing counsel.


10) What is this hedge?  Perhaps communion with Yahweh that naturally repels sin/evil?
I think so and I think the blessing is a different incarnation of the same thing.
# Job 37


12) clouds turned "round about" ~ spirals
  ...how did the ancients know that storms turn in spirals?
# Job 38

22-23) He has kept these back for war...what is this treasured weapon?
Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?
# Job

When was Job?
	Genesis 46:13 mentions a Job, son of Issachar
		this would mean Job was born after Joseph's sale and moved back to Midian after the migration


Eliphaz the Eloquent
Bildad the Brutal
Zophar the Zealous

Two kinds of people:
	those that have something to say
	those that have to say something

Job wasn't sinless, but he was blameless

The friends:
* never offer prayers, only Job prays
* argue theology w/ JobJoel 1


4) progressive decimation
  also references the life-cycle of the locust
Joel 2


16) The Chambers: when does the bride enter her private room?
When the shofar sounds the bride and groom emerge.

25-27) can we Christians claim this promise?  We certainly can: {Rom 3} {John 17}

25) Even a trashed life can be redeemed - given an extension, so to speak
  The devourer:
    Eats ~ 
    Hops ~ 
    Destroys ~ 
    Militarizes ~ 
    Sent by Yahweh ~ 
  Also refers to {Joel 1:4} predicting the undoing of the devastation
    
26) The redeemed:
  Not just eat but be satisfied
  Praise the name of Yahweh
  Remember His works
  Are not 'put to shame' ~ made ashamed, embarrassed, eclipsed
  
27) Israel is an example for all believers
  
28) [Acts 2:17]
Joel 3


Valley of Decision

{Matt 25:31-36}
John 12


36-40) Isaiah's authorship
	v.38 = [Is 53:1]
	v.40 = [Is 6:10]
	These two quotations come from the two "halves" of Isaiah - which blows up the multiple authorship theories.
John 15

The sections here, delineated by "these things I have told you"


Properties of fruit bearing ministries
	A. the branch must maintain a connection to Christ in order to bear fruit
	B. unfruitful branches are cut-off
	C. recently cut-off branches can still grow for a short time
	D. {Gal 6}


1) The members of the Trinity have distinctive roles

2) Being pruned is better than being than being taken away
	pruning ~ discipline {Prov 13:24}
						 {Prov 15:10}
					 	 {Prov 19:18} {Deut 21:18-21}
						 {Prov 22:15}
						 {Prov 29:17}
			~ removal of dead flesh {Gal 5:24}

3) 'Already' - when He washed their feet He declared them to have been clean, now their feet were clean as well
	'because of the Word' - physical hygiene is important (He gives us the example) but spiritual hygiene is moreso and is accomplished through the Word
	'that I have spoken' - not just any words, but His = {Prov 8:22}, {John 1}, {1Jn 2:28}
We are pruned by the Word

4) 'Abide'
		'in me' - how do we abide in Him?  it is more like being with Him; whereas He can truly be _in_ ~ Holy Spirit
	'bearing fruit' - this tells us the meaning of *abide* ~ to be attached to and nourished by.  The fruit is {Gal 5:22-23}

5) establishment of the foundational pattern of all things: one vine, many branches, and cruft
	'much fruit' ~ evidence of abiding; curiously, non-abiders can bear fruit, just not much.  It important to note that abiding is an action but not an outward one - this is not street-corner evangelism or working in a soup kitchen, those are results.  We must abide first, then He will ask of us those other things.
	'nothing' ~ apart from Him we can do nothing.  Not a little bit, or even temporary things...nothing {Jam 1:17}.

6) non-abiders are 'thrown away' {1Cor 5:13}
	'like a branch' ~ cast out like the dead flesh
	'and withers' ~ there is life for a time, but no nourishment (and maybe even fruit for a time, but not culmination)
	'burned' ~ the implication here is that those who are cast off from the vine are forever lost

7)	IF you abide in Him AND His Word abides in you (living with Him)
	THEN ask for anything and it will be done

8) Why does God answer these prayers? because it glorifies Him
	it glorifies Him when we bear fruit
	it glorifies Him when prove our allegiance to Him

9) How did the Father love Jesus?
	_That_ He loved Jesus is unquestionable {Matt 3:17} {Matt 17:5} {Mark 1:11} {Luke 3:22} {Luke 9:35}.  But how? by birthing Him, saving Him from the sword, maintaining His health and life until the appointed time...
	John 6

4-14) Jesus feeds 5000
  the disciple recognized 1) the correct raw materials but 2) incorrect quantities

  barley ~ the grain of there poor, Elijah did a similar (but lesser) miracle.  This also tells us the season.

  Under Moses there were no leftovers [of manna].  Under Jesus there were plenty.  [Deut 18:15]()


7) Philip does the math and sees the shortfall.  We cannot afford to turn people away- even if they starve to death; thankfully God is good and feeds the faithful.


9) interesting that the raw materials were brought by a child
 the child discerned the need
  perhaps the offering was meant just for Jesus and his disciples

10-11) sitting in the grass... grass symbolized the multitudes of sheep, when preparing to receive a gift they sat among the grass

12) "that nothing may be lost"
  disciples are instructed to glean the remainder
  they implication is that the leftovers should be used for purpose and immediately

13) the scraps doubly outnumber the original amount


16-17) interesting how they treat Jesus:
- they went to wait where they had arrived together
- when He doesn't show they takeoff...sure that He'll be fine or just scared and uncaring


22)	They noticed that Jesus left, but not in the boat
23) Why do we need to know this?
24)	they went to City of Comfort, seeking Emmanuel

25)	they found Him across the sea
	~ burial, flow of the Spirit
	...out of the sea = resurrection; across it would be ?rapture?
25b) they didn't know when He went
26) they didn't seek because of an experience but because of the Word
27) Mary/Martha ~ _work_ for the Word, not for food
		food distracts, it embowels us
		doctrine endures to eternal life
		...after which we will stand on the glassy sea/Spirit
	God has sealed Jesus, the foundation [2Tim 2:19]
28) "What must we do?"
		they already 'kept' the Law
29) the answer: believe in Emmanuel
		be an overcomer [Rev 2,3] [1Jn 5:4]
30) now they doubt?!  or the doubters become bold?
		"show us a sign!" the cry of the Sardicean
		"what work?"
			doubting that He believes?
			or, doubting that He keeps that Law?
31) our fathers partook of Manna
	...citing Scripture
32) displacing Moses - they relied on this belief
	'true bread'
33) ~ Elohim Emmanuel
	...gives life (mercy & grace)
34) "Sir" ~ appealing to His (non-existent) pride?
	"give us...always" so demanding...

35) Jesus said, "here I am!"
	come to Him and:
		never hunger ~ fill in our empty doctrine
		never thirst ~ experience God
36) But - you saw and disbelieved
37) those whom the Father gave Him = the called
	...they come automatically
	...He will never release them
38) I Am = Emmanuel
	only to do Yahweh's will
39) = lose nothing He was given
		not only people, but some of creation to be redeemed
	...raise it up on the last day
		out of (from) what?
40) Yahweh's will = everyone who looks on Jesus && believes in Him should have eternal life
	...raise him up on the last day
		out of (from) what?

41) they "grumbled" = evil intent
		because Jesus claimed to be the Word
42) "isn't this the bastard of Increase and Rebellion?" [Ps 69:8]
43) Jesus answered their grumbling
	...don't do it _among yourselves_
		God will hear our grumbling - but bring it to Him
44) no one can come to Him unless called
	calling = drawn
	...raise him up on the last day
45) Word quoting Scripture :)
	...in the Prophets [Is 54:13]
	everyone = all
	...who has heard AND learned
	...comes to Me
46) only Jesus had thus seen the Father
47) whoever believes has eternal life
48) He is the life-saving Word


60-71) The words are spirit and life

The spirit gives life; therefore the words give life and are life.

1) re: [prov 8:22-26]()


4) Every created thing has life, though not every created thing is dynamic, and not every dynamic thing is sentient, and not every sentient thing is human.  Thus, he says that light was given to humans~that is, an eternal self.  Further, this light was given, not lent, which carries with it the choice of being with Him or not.


33-34) aren't Church members those on whom the Spirit had fallen and remains?  Are we not, also, sons of God?
  Jesus was the first[fruit] as to the baptism of the Spirit and the baptizing of the Spirit.  We are the successors of the same.

# John 10

1-2) A shepherd _only_ enters through the door
...congregational membership?
Must have sheep to be a shepherd.

3) The gatekeeper opens the door.
Is the gatekeeper the Spirit? or a priest?

The sheep hear the shepherd - this seems to be a Holy Spirit proviso.
The shepherd calls his sheep by name
	This is necessarily personal
	Perhaps this gives a practical limit based on how many names he can coordinate.
The shepherd leads the sheep _out_
...out where?  Perhaps into the pasture (i.e. the Church)

4) The shepherd cont'd:
_When_ he has brought out his flock, all or none...?
He goes before them ~ _leading_.
The flock follows their shepherd.
The sheep know their shepherd's voice
...is this a practiced relationship?  Surely, it must be.

5) The flock:
...will not follow a stranger.
...flees from strangers
...knows their shepherd's voice (reiterated from v.4)
...does not know a stranger's voice

6) The _shepherd_ idiom is declared a spoken *paroimia*
...a proverb, figurative speech


22) dedication...in winter ~ i.e. Hannukah
	~ not a Mosaic feast
	~ an event based on events in the Macabbean revolt
	~ idiomatically future-referred as an important "feast"
	~ incidentally, the time of Jesus' conception


24-33) immediately after asking Jesus if he is the Messiah, He claims his deity and they balk- trying to stone him.


25) Jesus equates _works_ with _telling_
We have such a propensity to say things that are not corroborated by our actions.


34-38) believers are gods in the same way Abraham's offspring are like stars ~ there is a divinity present in the believer that is aloof in others.
Also, as in Acts 5, he foreshadows the eternal continuity of the Church instantiated through dispersion of power.  i.e. since the Spirit is in all believers the Church goes on in that power.

# John 11


Mary & Martha's appeal was based on their understanding of the Lord's love for them


35) Jesus shows His humanity.  Perhaps he cries because Lazarus had to return from Yahweh's presence.  Perhaps he is overcome by the range of emotions: genuine grief and ceremonial morning.


37) Are they elevating the importance of unblindedness above resurrection?
We might do well to think so...everyone will be resurrected, but not everyone to life with Yahweh.


44) "unbind him" ~ even we, after rebirth, are tangled up in our grave clothes for a time - and this takes an act of God
"let him go" ~ we are recreated to freedom, not into a particular path or mold.
# John 13


Jesus washed 24 feet that night.
...to include those of his betrayer.


outer garments symbolic of His divinity
- [Php 2:5-8]
- [Rev 1:12-16]

26-27) The Unsacrament
This is an interesting parallel to the Christian practice of _communion_.
This one time Jesus bestows damnation by giving the morsel.
We though, by his command, have the opposite power: to be included in adoption by choice - symbolized by the bread and wine.


34) A New Commandment = "love one another"

"just as I have loved you"
- taught
- washed feet
- sacrificed Hisself

", you also are to love one another"
- teach
- wash feet
- sacrifice ~ everything

# John 17

3) know ~ ginyskusin ~ hands-on knowledge


6) Jesus defines the theophany ~ a manifestation of Yahweh's name



20) This is a prayer for me - and you

21) "one" in nature 
- [1Pet 2:5] we are stones of the temple

22) One: God amongst Hisself __with__ us.  Unity.
# John 19


38-39) Interesting that these men's faith is a secret to the religious leadership but not to the worldly.
# John 2

The scope of the temple miracle:
- 10s of thousands of animals
- 10s of thousands of people
- 200-300 temple guards
- Roman oversight, actively watching
...yet took control and was given the authority

God was directing the worship.

This what will happen when Jesus enters the temple: He cleans house.


23-25) They loved what God did, but not Good Hisself

# John 20

1) The first day == Sunday
the tomb-stone was "taken away"
she did not investigate but ran to Simon Peter & John


3) Why does he mention that John outran Peter?


5) John saw the burial clothes but did not enter

6) Simon had no problem going in; was it because he knew there was no dead body? or because he didn't care about the law?

7) the head-cloth was folded up ~ ostensibly Jesus removed it and load it aside

8) John believed upon seeing the empty tomb


10-11) The men left but Mary stayed

12) 2 angels at the head & feet are like the mercy seat on the Ark


14-16) perhaps thru her tears, perhaps also because He was disfigured - she didn't recognize Jesus until he spoke her name

17) do not cling __because__ I not yet ascended - why because?
my Father, your Father; my God, your God ~ a message of adoption & inclusion for "the brothers"


19) the disciples still feared retribution

20) A leader known by His scars.


22) was the breath literal/ceremonial? or was it an indication of the transfer of the __pneuma__?

23) the stickiness of forgiveness, or its lack, seems to be a result of being Spirit-filled
We should be confessing to each other, this is encouragement to do that.


27) Jesus showed His scars to the others (v.20) but He offered a touch to Thomas

# John 21


6) How did the fish know to go the other side?
Why did they do what He said?
# John 3


Nicodemus represents religious leaders who want Jesus to be the answer.
~ but most parties are opposed to Jesus

Nicodemus approaches Jesus with dignity and honesty.
...this is something sorry lacking from most who approach the throne
...he eventually believed [John 19:39]

2) Nicodemus is coming to Jesus undercover.
Note the analogy of him coming to Jesus through the darkness.
Unlike other Pharisees Nicodemus doesn't ask a question - he has no hostile agenda.
...i.e. hostile could just as easily be "personal"


3) Without a leading question to overcome Jesus can cut straight to the His pet issue: rebirth


11) Who is "we" and "our"?  It must be God & man...all 3 faces of God.


14-18) He mixes tenses here - past, present, and future


14) [Num 21]


16) "God so loved" ~ past tense, since forever ago

perish/life ~ nothing to do with this realm, but a future one

eternal life ~ [John 17:3], starts now


21) Like [Ex 34:29] it is obvious who had been with God


25-30) Sometimes God makes ministries obselete.

31-36) Kind of a revamp of Jesus engagement with Nicodemus.
# John 5


6) Do you want to be healed?  some people do not; often they understand that they can be better but are afraid of the change.  Others do not understand and don't see their need.


12) The religious leaders ignore the amazing miracle and are, instead, looking to cast blame on whoever broke their rules.


24) not just belief but belief _from_ the heard Word
# John 7 




1-11) Capital Punishment for Adultery


7) the **first** stone
  ~ the people involved (family, witnesses) were all to stone the accused and they followed the leader


33) "we have never been in bondage" ~ hard to fathom the frame of mind that forgets the Exodus and their current subjugation to Rome 


44) the devil speaks lies "from his own resources"  ~ idios ~ self, nature
  devil ~ diabolos ~ the accuser




1-11) Capital Punishment for Adultery

# Jonah 1

Fleeing God's presence
- Adam & Eve his from the presence
- Cain left the presence [Gen 4]()
- Satan left God's presence [Job 2]()
- [Ps 139]() ~ can a believer truly leave the presence?

Tarshish
    [1Kgs 10]
    [Jer 10]
    [Ez 27]

    Heroditus said it was beyond the **Pillars of Hercules** = the straits of Gibraltar

Jonah is continually going down; The center of the Earth is the furthest down.


The storm was abnormal ~ it frightened seasoned sailors
...it was terrible enough to make them throw away their livelihood

5) How could Jonah sleep through the storm?  He was anesthetized by his depression.
We get lost in our rebellious way-of-life and ignore life.
We ignore the storms of life; even while our neighbors are throwing their lives away.

The pagan captain called the prophet to account.

Jonah was never forthcoming but waiting for the situation come to a head.

8) Where are you from?  Jonah was out of place

9) Jonah speaks religious truth; but his heart is not with Yahweh.

The sailors come to God through Jonah's ineptitude.

12) Jonah would not commit suicide, he asked to be thrown in.

13) Rowing harder never solves the problem, God solves the problem (v. 15)
  Is 64:6


16) Ironic that the pagan sailors actually feared Yahweh and Jonah did not...though he said so.
# Jonah 2

Did Jonah die in the fish?
Death seems more likely and with the resurrection sign in view it is not infeasible.
Also, he prayed from "the belly of Sheol", the grave.

Sign of Jonah
  [Matt 12:39]
  [Matt 16:4]
  [Luke 11:29]
  [Luke 11:30]

  1. The wicked ask for signs.
  2. Only one sign is given to the wicked: resurrection
  3. The wicked = this generation = Nineveh

Historical whale swallowing survivors:
- M.Deparvelle: 1891, James Bartley, Star of the East, Falkland Islands, 
- Harry Rimmer: English sailor, England

This book has many quotations from other scripture
Later scripture (i.e. Lamentations) draws from this peom
...this implication is two-fold:
  - Jonah knew scripture [very well]
  - Jonah's writing were well known and/or drew from common Jewish sacred phrases of the time

1) "From the bowels" ~ after a thousand moral choices that ended in the pit Jonah recognizes his fallenness.
He also recognizes that Yahweh is the answer - we are completely helpless.

1-2) prayed/cried
[Num 11:2]

2-9) vv.2-8 are past tense; vs.9 is present tense

2) Sheol ~ the abode of the dead
[Num 16:30,33] Korah's family went down to Sheol

3) heart of the seas ~ to the ancient mind this was as far away from God as possible - who dwelt atop the _dome of the skies_ that rested on the mountains
Jonah continues his downward path (down into the ship, down into the water, down into Sheol)

4,7) Jonah pines for the temple: he seemed his deep need for holy ground/sacred space.
We have this in the assemblies of the Church.

4) "again look upon" ~ interesting because Jonah was from the Northern kingdom

8-9) Jonah finally realizes his need and the one way to meet that need: Salvation from God

8) Mercy is forfeit via misdirected worship
An idol is a thing, other than Yahweh, that we think will give us security, significance, or acceptance.

9) The sincere desire to sacrifice comes from thankfulness.

[John 13:17]() ~ knowing is not enough, doing is necessary
# Jonah 3

I Am Jonah


Jonah did not actually _say_ no to God;
He simply "escaped".
For all his failings: Jonah did hear God and obey (under coercion.)

The Ninevehites worshipped Dagon, the fish god.
It is likely that Jonah's time in the fish "marked" him in some recognizable way.
Jonah would have been fishy smelling, bleached, and reputed.
- bleached white from stomach acid
- other fish survivors have similar outcomes

Jonah was racist.
Is denominationalism akin to racism?

God uses rebels and morons to proclaim His word.
...we are all rebellious and simple.
The miracle is not that God hated Esau but that God loved Jacob.

Demolish ~ Nehphket
...more like _transform_ than destroy
...the question is whether the end result of the transformation is good or not.

It's 550 miles from Samaria to Nineveh
- about a month's travel for Jonah
- spec: 40 days?

Such a time as this:
- [Est 4:10+]


1) "second time" ~ many Bible characters were given a second chance: Abraham, Moses, David
...this was the point of Stephen's sermon [Acts 7] which was interrupted by his death.

2) "that great city" this is probably a double reference to:
    a) the might of the kingdom represented by it's capital
    b) the city with it's suburbs (like _greater Houston area_)

3) "arose" ~ in contrast to the going down, down, down of chapters 1-2 he is going up now

4) Jonah never mentions God, nor redemption, in his preaching.
"avyd arbaym yvm vnynvh nhqcH

The Assyrians worshipped the fish god, Dagon.
They were likely impressed by the circumstances of Jonah.
Yahweh proved His superiority.


6) The king, through the Spirit's work, connects the dots based on Jonah's message.

7-10) Sargon preaches a better message then the man of God.
This reaction parallels Ahab's reaction [1Kgs 21:27]()
"sat in ashes" ~ a sorry of oneness with Sheol
This is biggest revival known to man.

10) "relented" ~ nacham, Yahweh halted his preparations for destruction;
...in fact He carries those out later



# Jonah 4

We love mercy when it's directed at us.
...not when it's for others.
We also tend to hope for the destruction of [other] sinners

1) 

2) How dispicable are we to be angry at God's favour.
Jonah was trying to prevent this.

3) Jonah's second plea for death


5) Jonah never answers God's question.
Jonah again leaves and makes his own shelter.
Jonah is still going for his will
[Ex 34:6]

6) Jonah's shade was insufficient so God provided the difference.
Jonah still needed his head covered.

The plant is __qiqayon__ ~ probably palma christi (the castor bean plant)
...it can grow 12-18" per day
- [1Kgs 7:24]()

The plant is symbolic of _the comforts of home_.


11) Interesting that God slew as many Asyrians in one night during Hezekiah's reign.
These people were innocent - in the sense that they didn't know right from wrong.  Not deserving of mercy but God's jealousy burns anyway.


# Jonah Overview

The book of Jonah was written during or close after the exile.
Three facets
- Upside-downness
- I am Jonah
- Providence

Event occurred around 759BC

Only Jonah, Isaiah, Elijah, and Elisha are mentioned by Christ [by name].

Characters
- God
- Jonah
- Sailors
- King
- Fish

Places
- Israel
- Assyria
- Nineveh
- Sea

Jonah was:
- a patriot (see Ch. 1 notes).
  - [1Kgs 14] ~ Jonah prophesied that the northern kingdom's territory would expand under Jeroboam II
  - did not want to help his enemies
- a contemporary of Hosea, Amos, and Jeroboam
- from Galilee, [2Kgs 14]()
  - 4mi NE of Nazareth
  - [John 1:46]()
  - []

Jesus taught of the sign of Jonah (see Ch. 2 notes)
- Luke 11
- Matthew 12

There is no mention of Israel in the book;
This book is read annually at Yom Kippur: "I Am Jonah"

Jonah was from Gath-Hepher [2Kgs 14:25] which was a little north of Nazareth
...[John 1:46]


===

This book is upside-down
- the prophet of God is running away
- sailors worship God
- the gentile nation is repentant
- the message is neither grace or mercy
- the messenger is regretful of God's mercy
- though saved, Jonah was reluctant to share such

4 Throws
4 Fears
31) Those that have known the works of the LORD passed on their faith.
We ought to pray for great occurrences for the next generation to see and know the LORD.
May 18, 1448BC# Joshua 1


5) "I will not leave you or forsake you"
... like Deut 31:6,8
... this promise could not made to His own sonJoshua 11



21-22) A summation of the conquest.
Also, a grim foreshadowing of things to come.
Partial obedience is disobedience...the consequences of which are the dark ages of the Judges (and beyond).
# Joshua 5

A theophany ~ this man commands hisself to be worshipped.
The resultant violations of the law are a result of this meeting between Joshua and Yahweh.
# Joshua

It is known that there was a great upheaval in Canaan around 1250BC  
...attributable to Joshua's conquest.
...it is with noting that modern scholars doubt the historicity of much of the book ~ many believing scholars emphasize it's theological nature above the endowed events

Evidence does show the overthrow of some cities mentioned in the book:
- Jericho
- Lachish
- Hazor
...but many others appear to have been quietly assimilated (if anything.)
Judges 10


Tola - worm/scarlet
	caramese vermilio (worm)
	[Ps 22]
		scarlet
		wormJudges 11


9) [Prov 25:6-7]
... you bring me
... I fight
... Yahweh wins
... I rule
Judges 13

v. 12,17
	'words' is actually singular in the Hebrew, implying one promiseThere was no king in Israel.
Everyone did what was right in the their own eyes.

The paradigm:
- immortality
- favor


1) This theophany is a common pattern in the book


4) Everyone _heard_ what the LORD said and wept
  ...however, they seemed not to fully repent


8-10) The faith was not passed on to subsequent generations.
Interesting that Joshua was a tremendous Commander but didn't successfully establish a legacy that would last generations.
Contrast: Ezra & Nehemiah did establish a legacy that lasted centuries.


15-16) "Nevertheless" ~ despite Israel's departure God never let them go

21-23) God left the thorns because of His people's disobedience


[Ps 106]()

The downfall of Israel is a 4-century fade-out# Judges 6

13) Now that Gideon was taught by his parents: a lineage of faith.
Judges 7

	Jerub Ba'al - contends with Ba'al

	the 300
		Josephus says these were the watchful
    they cupped water in their hands, able to lookout
    ...those that knelt weren't able to lookout


Lights in Jars
	_the broken vessel_
	[2Cor 4:6-12]
	the ember ignites when freed into open air
Judges 8


the ornaments on the camel's necks
	the Ishmaelites put golden crescent moons on the camels
	they worshipped the Moon god 'Sin'
Judges 9


You become like the god you worship
	[Ps 115:8]# Judges 3

We become like what we worship:
- gods are
  - harsh
  - unforgiving
  - greedy
  - defeated
- Yahweh is
  - gracious
  - merciful
  - charitable

Baalim and _the groves_:
  The groves are phallic symbols the represent gods


Judge Othniel
10) the Spirit of the LORD 
    1) the secret of the judges' success
    2) our secret as well

11) 40 years rest ~ 2 generations

12) Evil again


Judge Ehud
15) left-handed (or handicapped w/ his right-hand; i.e. crippled)
    1)  left-handedness was "wrong"; i.e. considered a deficiency
    2)  Judges 20, 1 Chronicles 1 ~ Benjamites were trained ambidextrous
    3) "Benjamin" means son of the right hand;  they had become left-handed assassins


17) Eglon ~ "very fat"
    1)  the knife was two-edged (meant for stabbing) and 1.5' long


21) because Ehud was left-handed the guards didn't search him properly

22) Eglon's diameter was over 18" (cubit) which makes his circumference *at least* 


24) "covereth his feet" means he's defacating


28) after the assassination Ehud gives credit to Yahweh and rallies the troops


Judge Shamgar
31) ox goad ~ 8' long pole with an iron prod on one end and a spade on the other
  [1Sam 13] the enemies always confiscate the weapons

# Judges 4


[1Cor] ~ the foolishness of God;  Yahweh uses some of the oddest, most unlikely things to save (to showcase His sovereignty)


4-10) God accomplishes His will whether we are compliant or not.
His requirement is that we are presente, attentive, and follow.


Opportunity by Edward Rowland Sill


Judge Deborah
- Jabin
  - enemy leader 
  - chariots of iron
- Sisera
  - enemy general
- Deborah ~ honey-bee
  - industrious
  - discerning
  - sweet
- Barak
  - heroic general
  - he hesitated and required Deborah to go with him
    - he recognized the value of having a women judge
  - he is listed in the [Heb 11]() hall of faith

The cry is for deliverance, not forgiveness (i.e. no repentance)
The notation of a female judge is derogatory to a patriarchal society


2) Harosheth-haggoyim ~ forest of the gentiles


11,17-23) Jael the Kenite
  - this is the tribe of Moses' father-in-law
  - Heber departed from his tribe, but his wife remained faithful
    - this sets up Sisera's death because he trusted this Kenite even though the wife was loyal to her roots
# Judges 5


12-19) Deborah's song
  The kings/nobles fought 
  - those who didn't fight were not amongst these
  Fighters
  - Ephraim
  - Benjamin
  - Machir
  - Zebulun
  - Issachar
  - Barak
  Slackers
  - Reuben
  - Gilead
  - Dan
  - Asher


19) there was no monetary gain from the victory


20)    The stars fought
  -  Stars are idiomatic for angels [Rev 1]() or other divine beings


28-30) The evil general's motherly influence:
  - she was looking for spoils, return on her investment in her son
# Judges

A tragedy; good vs. evil
- this style of literature exposes horrible consequences and imbues a desire for something better
  - i.e. there doesn't have to be told a happy ending for the reader to need it, this is the brilliance of the stories
  - i.e. much of the Bible is stories rather than sermons because that is what sticks
  - e.g.
    - Orestes
    - Hamlet, Othello, etc.
- in this sense Judges is prophetic: it gives a pattern of the serious decline before the King rules


Took place roughly 1382-1063BC

Deborah's victory in 1216BC per archaeology @ Hazor

It seems that the events in Judges were not necessarily consecutive.
This is likely because Joshua's conquest happened around 1250BC.


Issues
1. No king in Israel
2. Everyone "did what right in their own eyes"
   1. This language reminds of of the days of Noah
3. God's people can't work together
   1. Christians make their firing squads in circles
4. God's people are in bondage
   1. They HAD conquered the land
   2. The occupation is failed


Structure
0. The Cycle
   1. Sin
   2. Oppression
   3. Repentance
   4. Deliverance
   5. Peace
   - The judges are progressively more unfamiliar with Yahweh
1. Failure to occupy and complete the conquest; Chapters 1 - 2:5
2. Prologue; Chapters 2:6 - 3:6
3. Ehud; Chapter 3
4. Deborah;
5. Barak
6. Jael
7. Gideon
8. Abimelech
9.  Jephthah
10. Samson
11. Dan @ Laish
12. Gibeah
13. Benjamite fratricide


False Gods
1. Ashteroth
2. Astartai


Perennial Pockets of Conflict
- Still today these cities are centers of rebellion against Israel
1. Jerusalem
2. Hebron
3. Jericho
4. Gaza


Technology
- at this time the Philistines had an edge with iron chariots
- later the Israelites would have steel weapons...giving them the edge

Holiness Code
	chapters 17 - 20# Leviticus 18


6-19) "uncovering" or "seeing" "nakedness" is idiomatic of sexual intercourse.
Note that this is not depraved because of the act or the desire but _because it breaks the model_:
	One bride [Church]
	One groom [Christ]
	No separation
# Leviticus 19


18) The 2nd commandment
Leviticus 2


2) The oil recipe is in [Ex 30:25-36]
	Frankincense indicates priesthood
Leviticus 23


[Heb 11:13-14]

Spring (incarnation):
  Passover | death
  Unleavened Bread | burial
  Firstfruits | resurrection
  Shavuot | indwelling

Fall (return):
  roshashannah | trumpets
    yom trua, 'trua' ~ onomatopoeia
    {Gen 22} sacrifice of Isaac
    {Ps 119:60} quick to obey
  yom kippur | day of atonement
    Tradition: life < now > death
  sukot | tabernacles
    Jesus' birthday
    [Zech 14]()
  Rest as in music, not as in sleep = a pause to remember.

2) Yehovah's appointments: mo'ed.
  

23) 
Leviticus 24


15-16) 'his God', 'the name of the LORD', 'the Name' are all synonomous
# Leviticus 6

The Five Songs


Chapter 1-2


Elizabeth

Mary

Angels

Simeon

Anna?
# Luke 1


3) "most excellent" is also found in [Acts 23,24,26] ~ it means this person is a civil authority

4) This document + [Acts] may be preparatory material for Paul's trial.

5) Knowing that Zech was in the course of Abijah allows us to date JtB's conception birth; because we know what course was on duty when the temple was sacked in 70AD
...JtB born on Passover
...thus Christ's birth ~ Sept. 29th (Feast of Trumpets, Tabernacles)

Zechariah = He remembers
Elizabeth = His oath

Incarnation Sequence Part 1
- Gabriel messaged Mary
- 


13) JtB = [Is 40:3]

14-17)
Seven aspects of JtB:
- joy & gladness
- great before the LORD
- nazirite
- filled with Holy Spirit
- pastor
- leader (as Elijah)
- giver of wisdom


19) Gabriel is always on missions regarding the Messiah

20) Zech was made deaf + dumb as a sign


There is a legend that Zechariah also took Elijah's mantle and gave it to JtB


34) [John 8] is an exchange regarding parentage


41-43) Note that JtB was a fetus and was a human able to be Spirit-filled.
Note, also, that Elizabeth is regarding Jesus (a zygote at this point) as her "LORD" - he is absolutely human at this point.


62) Zech was deaf & dumb, hence the signs


64) This whole scenario culminated in Yahweh worship
# Luke 10

The phrase "The Kingdom of God is at hand" is either a welcome or warning depending on who hears.


The lawyer wanted to "justify" himself; i.e. he wanted to say that he would love _his_ neighbors...rather than _be_ a neighbor.


30) Jesus replied with a story ~ often the most effective teaching

The priest and the Levite were both following the law in avoiding the "dead" man.  They did the moral thing - but not the ethical one.

The Samaritan should not have been on the road - it was for Jews only.  This is typefully "us" who are on the path meant for the Jews (which they abandoned, thus God paved for us.)


apathy, comfort, and favoritism are the enemies if neighboring
# Luke 11

1) teach us to pray
"as John" they want teaching like John's disciples received

first he gives a formula (vv2-4) then a proof (vv5-13)

2-4)
father, hallowed be thy name
your kingdom come
give us daily bread each day
forever us or sins
# Luke 15

Of the 4 lost characters, 3 the which father goes to get, the prodigal was drawn back.

All three display God's joy over a sinner's repentance

Trinitarian allusion:
 shepherd ~ Son
 bride+light ~ Spirit
 father ~ Father

1-3) Directed at the religious elders because they don't see people the way God sees them.

4-7) 1%, very few sheep go astray and the shepherd goes to get them.

8-10) 10%, of the images are sought.
The woman is that one who goes to search.


12) The was no bank, the father would have had to liquidate one-third of his assets.
- one-third of the angels fell

18-19) The son was rehearsing a speech to manipulate the Father.
The Father circumvents the sons' plan, not by barring him, but by running to meet him.

20) The Father dies not even give the son the chance to approach and present his planned speech.
He runs, at the first sight of his lost son, and:
  1. Embraces him = acceptance as a son
  2. Kisses him = identifying in common nature


22) New garb:
  Robe ~ regnalty
  Ring ~ signet of the King's authority
  Sandals ~ renewed belief


Luke 16


1-13) The Unjust Steward
8) A commendation for assuring his future via wise action
	i.e. Be shrewd


19-31) The Underworld Tale
# Luke 18

The Unjust Judge
  prior to this he was teaching about his imminent coming
  be persistent
  "Not all prayers are created equally." Philip Ryken
  Practical atheism: acting as if you do not believe.
  Perhaps the judge is the earthy rulership and she is the Church.
  The judge is not God: Yahweh is loving, patient, and attentive.


9-14) The Pharisee and the Sinner
God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
The Pharisee was twice decieved: that he is better than others, and that that matters.
The tax collector was estranged, ashamed, and despondent.

# Luke 19


19) Faithfulness + Trustworthy = Authority

20-22) worthless servant was judged according to his own impression of the Master

Unfaithfulness + Disobedience = Condemnation


42) [Rom 11:25]() ~ i.e. the blindness of the Jews until "fullness of the Gentiles"

43) "thou knowest not the day" ~ Jesus held them accountable to know & understand the signs of the times
# Luke 2


Human Messiah ~ [Gen 3:15]()

Jewish Messiah ~ [Gen 12] [Num 24]

Judahic ~ [Gen 10]

Davidic ~ [2Sam 7]

Born of virgin ~ [Is 7:14]


[Jer 1:12] ~ God is precise in His plans


The sequence
- The registration drove Joseph & Mary to Galilee
- Mary gave birth in a manger
- Shepherds were informed by "an angel of the Lord"
- Shepherds went to Mary & Joseph
- Circumcision

10) "Don't be afraid" is a platitude - it really can't be helped


14) peace among those with whom He is pleased
among ~ en = constructively "in" and "to"


28) Simeon blessed God ~ it is not the result that makes it a blessing but the intention


29) _depart_ ~ to loose or unyoke; all of meanings fit we as prisoners set free


39)
Nazareth overlooks the plain of Esdralon, beyond which is Mount Meggido


49) Jesus first quote (chronologically)
Jesus only referred to Yahweh as Father - except at His separation on the cross
	[Mark 13:32] ~ a limit to the human Jesus' knowledge; how much did He need to learn and grow into?
	[Rev 1:1] ~ the book is written **TO** Jesus
# Luke 22

35-38) The Two Swords

Perhaps this is a chiastic center where Jesus is foreshadowing the disciples rebellion
Luke 23


26-31) During His darkest day, in a brief reprieve, Jesus takes the opportunity to lift the despairing followers.


31) Green wood is no longer a valid party of the plant, neither is it good for kindling.  The destitute exist interstitially between useful states- the fold of a loving chiasm.


44-49) Responses to the cross
  44-45.  The Father grieved
  46. Christ enacts
  47. The mystic is amazed - and testified
  48. The scornful beat their chests - and left
  49. The disciple is distant - and left
# Luke 3

77 generations Adam -> Jesus
70 generations Enoch -> Jesus
	maybe intentional to reflect the judgment span of Shemihazah and watchers
Luke 4


Jesus faith, hope, and love are tested


3) The physical is an incomplete representation of man's need [Php 3:19]

4) There is nothing secular before His throne


6) 'for it has been delivered to me'
	God has allowed Lucifer to possess all authority and glory of the Earth
	Jesus does not challenge this possession!  But, He will come back to undo it.


12) [Deut 6:13]


[Dan 9:27] ~ _wing of abomination_ hints at a pinnacle (an architectural term)


17) Jesus quotes [IS 61:] **but** leaves out the _day of vengeance_ ~ this ommission is the abstenscion for the Church era
	some of the terms used are in [PS 82], as in [JOHN ?]

	this was likely the Jubilee year


25) [1Kgs 7:17]


28) They were angry because he was preaching salvation for Gentiles.


41) Jesus did not want the testimony of demons
# Luke 5


Genessarit ~ Galilee ~ heart-shaped lake, Horns of Hatton mt. range

"Not every fishing boat is a pulpit, but every pulpit is a fishing boat."

4) Jesus is always in command

5) "Master" ~ there was prior respect
Miracles are preceded by obedience


8) This is the normal response of people confronted by God - true humility.
[Job 42:5-6]
[Is 6]
[Rev 1:17]


12) The leper broke the law to come in.

The 2 lies of sin:
1. There's nothing wrong with me
2. There's nothing that can be done for me

leprosy was "cleansed" rather than "healed" ~ indicative of the replacement notion of redemption


Things that don't mix:
- feasting and fasting
- new patch on an old garment
- new wine in old skins


[Mic 6:8] in opposition to our view of righteousness and associations
# Luke 6


[Deut 23] ~ passerby feeding

Sunday is not Shabbat

Shabbat was made for man, not man for Shabbat

11) Jesus was phenomenally merciful towards sinners who came to Him.
However, He vituperatively humiliated the religious leaders.

12) ALL NIGHT prayer by the LORD...


Path to happiness (also evidences of salvation)
- faith in God
- love toward others
- honesty
- obedience to God


20) [Prov 30:8-9]
[Is 61] [Luke 4:18]


No one is recorded to have died in Christ's presence.

Attitudes toward: others, ourselves, God.
[Prov 30]


[Ps 42]


27) Who are God's enemies?  Us.
[Rom 8:5]


36) Be merciful
Judgmentalism by humans is typically just a pleasuring sport.

_magnanimous_
[Ps 135:18] ...who do you want to be like?


43-45) You can tell a person's _leaning_ by how they speak.
Interesting that everyone has treasure:
What makes treasure good or evil?  _thesauros_ means a container of treasure; i.e. the chest with the gold.
  "the abundance of the heart" ~ implying every heart is filled with something?  at least, every heart that speaks is filled...


46) [Ps 115:8]


Judas Iscariot ~ Ahitophel
...betrayal + suicide
# Luke 7

Centurion: "I am a man with authority **also**" ~ he understands Christ's authority


41-43) The Lender
The one of greater debt appreciates forgiveness more.
~ the greater realization is that every human has an insurmountable debt; thus, our appreciations converges as we are sanctified.

44) He said _to_ Simon ~ "I entered _your_ house" ~ the pharisee was named Simon.

44-47) Washing ~ not water & rags, but tears and hair-covering
Kissing ~ not to the face, but to the feet
Anointing ~ not the head & oil, but the feet & expensive ointment

48,50) "Your sins are forgiven", "Your faith has saved you" ~ Jesus is not decreeing her absolution, he is declaring it.
The woman's actions reveal that she has chosen Him as her master; Jesus is telling them what the benefit of that allegiance is.

50) "go in peace" ~ note that there is no list of admonitions here!
It is a simple statement of acceptance - the behavior will come from the heart, not vice versa.
# Luke 9

18-19) "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
- John the Baptist ~ a popular, anti-authority Yahweh follower
- Elijah
- some prophet


22) "Who do you say that I am?"
- "you" is you ~ the person reading the passage...the person walking with Jesus, in His crowd
# Malachi 1

6-7) In general we dishonor God by engaging in His prescriptions as hollow religion


9-11) God doesn't want our offerings. 
He wants us and our contrition. 
# Malachi 2


17) God is wearied by constant blame and doubt:
   Their expectation is to prosper and rule- which is not unfounded, it is a promise of God
   However, God's timing is different and involves the time needed to sanctify of the nation 
# Malachi 3


2) refiner's fire is hot enough to melt metal
...the purpose being to forcibly separate impurities for removal (the dross)
fuller's soap is meant for cleansing cloth
...it is harsh and leaves the cloth able to be dried and "fulled" i.e. fluffed and workable and ready to accept a dye 



3)

4)

5) Matthew 25:31-47

6)


7) you were born into a world that had already rejected Yahweh
"LORD of hosts" ~ the commander of the greatest army 
  He beckons us to come to him
 The question of how to return] is answered by a rhetorical:

8) We have robbed God...by withholding tithes and contributions; i.e CHARITY

9) The curse is a result of our withholding and it affects the whole nation.
Theirs was a nation known for, and dedicated to, Yahweh; yet, they refrained from their duty.
Remember, this was after the return from exile and the 2nd Temple Ezra-rabbinic revival!

10) Yahweh request a test of _Him_: bring the full tithe and see if He will not meet our needs.
  In an agrarian society the floodgates of heaven means a good crop; this requires work to [eventually] bring the harvest.
    Our greatest blessing is the opportunity to work fruitfully.

12) Further, all external hindrances to prosperity will be removed.  Note that we still have to work the land and pick the fruit...

13) The reason for this blessing is: that the nations will notice and come to know God.
# Mark 1


21-27) conversion is not a peaceful transfer of power

23) "he cried" ~ is it the man or the demon?  It is both, they are united


34) He healed
- diseased
- possessed
	these two are Biblically distinct
Mark 16


15) Does this mean preach to plants and animals?  Or that only humans amount to the "whole creation"?
Mark 9


1) What is the kingdom then?  The power of the earth cracking, veil rending, and resurrection and ascension?

2) transfigured ~ [Rom 12:1-2] [John 17:23+]


4) Moses and Elijah ~ the Law and the Prophets; but in reverese order.


21-25) Yahweh gives belief; it is not an intellectual or spiritual things but tangible, physical

22) "if"?  The father is honest and transparent.

23) This is not belief in oneself but belief in God and His purposes.

24) Again, the father is painfully honest.
[Matt] says the father was on his knees
[Luke] says this was the father's only child


32) they were afraid to ask - afraid He was being literal, afraid of breaking out of their paradigm

33) an inappropriate, ill-timed argument

34) ...the bragging fishermen
  They had the prestige of being hand-picked

35) the formula for success
  {Matt 5:19} the role of the law in success
  {Matt 25:21}
  {Matt 19:27+}
  Jesus does not discount or dampen their desire for greatness - He is pointing out that their idea of greatness is flawed; greatness is servanthood, the way to servanthood is to server
  
  {1Pet 5:5-6} in God's timing
  
36) {Luke 22:26}
  1st century children had the lowest status

37) the association mapped out by God

# Mark
~ Jesus Christ the servant


Adoration is love upwards focused

Affection is love for a peer

Grace is love descending


the times Jesus predicts his death, the disciples react, and He teaches
  {8:31+}

  {9:30+}

  {10:32+}
Mark 10


Paradoxes herein:
- Two shall be one
- Adults shall be as children
- Die to live
- First are last
- Servants are rulers


1-12) Jesus on Divorce
	[Deut 24:1-4]


21) Jesus _loved him_
...perhaps this detail tells us that this was John-Mark
	Wealth is wonderful servant, but a terrible master


46) Bartimaeus
	v.47: _Son of David_ = nationalistic title
	v.51: _Rabbi_ = personal title
# Mark 11


The Donkey Related Poem Content Details
BY G. K. CHESTERTON


13-14, 20-25) Jesus, who was familiar with the land, was not surprised by the lack of fruit.
This was an acted out parable about fruitfulness.
[Mic 7:1-6]


15) Flipping a table in a crowd is a huge ruckus.
_pigeons_ are the sacrifices of the poor - they were capitalizing on the poor.
	[Ps 69:9]()

[Ps 141:2]

17)
	[Is 56:7]()
	[Jer 7:11]()


30) Why does He bring up JtB?
Because they were stuck on it...they can't move on until dealing with that truth.
# Mark 12


1-11) The Owner
[Lev 19]
It was in the 4th year that the son went.
[Heb 13]


17) The single most influential political statement _ever_


28-31) A New Shema

31) 'commandment' is singular; 'these' is plural.
He is not equating these decrees but combining them.
Actually, he is recognizing that the two decrees are a single command.


34) _not far_ ~ similarly John Weseley, by his own admission, was not saved until over a decade _into his vocational ministry career_.
# Mark 13


10) preached = _kerysso_ ~ herald
# Mark 14


13) It seems that a man carrying a jar was unusual; normally the men would have carried a bag of liquids (i.e. wineskin) while women carried pitchers.

47) Jesus healed this ear - which saved Peter from being arrested and executed (because he was not a Roman citizen.)
# Mark 15


[Gen 49:10]
	When the Romans removed the Sanhedrin's power this amounted to the remomval of the scepter - what they bemoaned as a breaking of the Word of God really conincided with the birth of certain young boy in Bethlehem.


[Heb 11] [Rom 4] [Gal 3]


33) [Amos 8:9-10]


41) Love of children and women is telling...it is also the key to societal change.
# Mark 4


12) Do they not want forgiveness?  Or does God not want to forgive, in order to save even more?
	[Is 6:9-10]
	[Acts 28:26]
	[Rom 11:8]


15) _immediately_ ~ Satanic minions are always at hand

The Sower ~ [John 20:21]
	The imagery of the two seas in Israel is telling: The Galilee is a provider and a source of life, The Dead Sea endlessly receives and outputs nothing.

32) birds are Satanic minions


One of these boats was discovered in modern times and was 26' x 7'.

35) Jesus prompted them to go, knowing a storm would come - can He be trusted?  Yes.

36) They left the crowd.
Jesus took them, "just as He was".
_Other boats_ ~ what happened to these other boats?


38) Some of them were professional fishermen - and they were afraid...but Jesus was not.  Things indicates that the storm was supernaturally crazy.
Jesus had to be roused.

39) Jesus muzzled the storm.  He used exorcism language against the storm.

40) Their lack of faith was forgetting/ignoring that Jesus had told them to cross the lake.
Their lack of seeing possibilities: maybe they were desperate for a new method or course; but He simply removed the obstacle.

Part of this exercise was to prepare the disciples for the upcoming encounter with Legion.

# Mark 5


The Incurables

The decapolis (ten "cities") whose swine herds served the gentile populace.


These unclean spirits had to have Jesus permission to change venue.
However, the unregenerated are able to be captured by them: [2Tim 2:26]

The demoniac needed recreation, not reformation.


30) Who touched my garments?
Jesus calls for the woman's testimony.


34) _Daughter_ ~ what a pronouncement!
A child of God at a single touch...


39)
No soul-sleep:
	[Php 1:20]
	[Jam 2:26]


42) Why the parenthetical note about her age?
Note that the girl and the woman's ailment were the same age.
- On the way to heal the Jew Jesus healed the 
Gentile
# Mark 6


13) [Jms 5:14]


30-32) you _need_ rest
self-care is not selfish
[Matt 11:29]
[1Cor 6:20]
a victim mentality is a sign of fatigue
[Luke 5:15-16]
[Matt 6:33-34]
[James 4:8]

39) Why does the Spirit point out the grass color?
This indicates season and weather and locale.
This also reveals some about the thrust of the letter.
	[Ps 78:19] ~ yes
	[Ps 132:15]


42) All were _satisfied_.


48) Jesus left no footprints here :P


51) When He got into the boat the storm ceased

52) The apostles participated in the miracle and were still hardened and misunderstanding.
# Mark 7


3) This tradition was Mishnaic, not Torahic.
[Ex 30:19] does not go this far.


8-13) The process of mishandling Logos
- Elevate something else to Scriptural level
- Reject Scripture
- Add to Scripture
- Void the Scripture

9) We would rather embrace tradition than Scripture itself.


11) Corban means a thing is _dedicated to the LORD_.
Which means they can withhold help they are obliged to give because a thing is _dedicated to the LORD_.


15) Jesus is here rewriting clean/unclean.
This notion predates the Law [Gen 7:2,8]
[Acts 10] ~ Peter envisions this changeover.


22) coveting ~ "evil eye"


31) This is Jesus only venture outside of Israel


33) Jesus may be _signing_ to the man.
The first words the man heard were "be opened."
Jesus was very hands on.
	Is He the Messiah: do the blind see? the deaf hear? the dumb speak?
Mark 8


8) These "baskets" are wicker hampers...unlike the handbaskets of the earlier miracle.
	[Ex 16]


16) Perhaps they assumed Jesus was, like they would do, making a back-handed rebuke.


21) Jesus admonished them to understand these things: He was not rebuking them for not bringing bread.


23) Jesus took the man out of town because Bethsaida was previously cursed.

24) Interesting that the man knew was men and trees looked like: he was probably not blind from birth.
Also, interesting that he was seeing these _trees_ as men.
- Trees are idiomatic for divine council members
- [Ez 31]
- They were walking...where at? where to?

25) Jesus laid hands _again_ - this is where the man's sight was restored, previously it was not restoration but a vision.
Matthew 16


5)	the setup - they had forgotten to bring "bread"
	how easily do we get spoilt

6)	watch and beware of _leaven_
		the insidious thing that grows exponentially and imbues everything with poison gas (CO2)
	Pharisees = legalism
	Sadducees = non-authoritative scripture

7)	"We brought no bread."
		the realization
		taking responsibility?

8)	Jesus was already aware of this
		"why bother discussing it?"

9-10) Do you not _yet_ perceive
	implying that the answer is there for the uptake
	He also admonishes them to recount the past
	~ evidence of God's work

11)	not about bread but Manna
	again warning about yeast/apostasy

12)	the connection begins to form
		a fragile connection that must be built up

13-18) The Foundation Stone
Petros ~ a stone
...as opposed to...
Petra ~ rock, _the_ rock

It's interesting that this took place at the foot of Mount Hermon:
This was known as the _gates of hell_
 ~ mountains were the abode of the gods and this particular mountain was, historically, the place where the Watchers descended to Earth.
 I.e. Jesus is literally building the Church at the gates of hell.

16,23) Peter's finest hour and his downfall
Matthew 6

14-15) Does this mean God's forgiveness relies on our actions?
I don't think so: rather, God's forgiveness is a communal act that is inhibited by our mistreatment of others.


25- 34) "Therefore" - after establishing the idea of a Master Jesus expounds on the benefits of having Yahweh as a master

31) anxiety about:
	food ~ manna
	drink ~ spirit
	clothing ~ belief

32) gentiles seek these, those who don't know the Master
	Abba knows that you need them

33) 1st: seek Kingdom of God (free to join)
		 seek _His_ righteousness (freely given)
	all these things are added - v.31

34) Ultimately Providence teaches us that we should not borrow trouble, we are given work here and now and all else is God's domain.

# Matthew 1

Genealogy
- Rahab was around at the beginning of the conquest ca1250BC
- David's reign begins around 1000BC
- That's 5 generations in 250yrs ~ 50yr/gen
- That go gives ~1250yr which does line up with the incarnation (Sept 11, 3BC)
- Five women
  - Tamar
  - Rahab (g)
  - Ruth (g)
  - Uriah's Wife (Bathsheba)
  - Mary

The sequence "came about this way"
1. Joseph & Mary engaged
2. Mary became pregnant "from the Holy Spirit"
3. Joseph decided to divorce Mary secretly
4. "an angel of the Lord" appeared to Joseph in a dream and changed his mind


The plan
1. Give birth to a son
2. Name Him Jesus
3. He will save His people from their sins

The prophecy
- [Is 7:14]()
- 


11) Jeconiah's line was cursed [Jer 22:28-30]()

Matthew 10


1) What's the difference between apostles and disciples?
At this time the 12 are called disciples and are given:
- authority over unclean spirits
- exorcism ability
- disease and afflication healing

	Were these abilities ever revoked?

2-4) The apostles are named.
	Matthew - always adds the tax collector label to his name
20) 
Matthew 12


1-7) Gleaning on Shabbat
	Why were the Pharisees there?  Were they following, tagging along?
	[1Sam 21:1-6]

7) [Hos 6:6]
	Note that He calls them 'guiltless' - He has not yet been sacrificed but is ?already viewing them from that perspective?


10) Is it lawful?  Is it valid to ask that question of the law-maker?
	bottom-line: it is lawful to do good on Shabbat

	Sheep were their livelihood, they didn't let Shabbat interfere with their livelihood but, rather, used it as an excuse not to do good.


13) The man is a type of pre-believing Israel, who must reach out to be healed and whose healing is used as a public example to all onlookers.


18-21) [Is 42:1-3]


24) "this fellow" ~ houtos ~ a derogatory denial if Jesus status as a teacher and Messiah


32) Speaking against the Holy Spirit, in this case, means ascribing the works of God to fallen angels and demons.
	It is the Holy Spirit that convicts us, Jesus who justifies us, and the Father that frees us.


38) They _answered Him_ with a question; they are opposing His authoritative eschatology {judgment day}

39) A door is closed here.  Only the Jonahic sign remains for them.

40) Where is the "heart of the earth"?  the center?  that sounds silly except that we know very little about spacetime and what's really inside the earth.
...this ties _Sheol_ to the "heart of the earth".


43-45) _this evil generation_ = Israel; which is an example as it was cleansed and then ended up worse off because the evil ejection was not replaced with Jesus


[Hos 5:14]
Matthew 13

deals with subject matter not in the Old Testament
"hidden since the foundation of the world"

{Eph 3} ~ The Church

2) Interesting that He could proclaim, they could see Him, but they could not touch Him

3-9) The Sower
	[Is 55:11]
	The Path
		impenetrable, no soil
		no birth
		no growth
		birds ate the seed
	Rocky Ground
		a little soil
		successful birth
		immediate growth
		withered under the sun [1Cor 3:13]
	Thorny Ground
		good soil
		successful birth
		growth
		adjacent weeds killed them
	Good Soil
		good soil
		successful birth
		multiplicative growth
		no death

9) How many have ears?  Repeated multiple times in [Rev 2-3]

10-17) The purpose of a parable
	1. It is for the unknowing
	2. It is for understanding
	3. It introduces a new perception
	4. It pricks the heart
	5. It is a blessing

12) What is this "more understanding"?
  It is more knowledge, general revelation: information; "an abundance of teaching."
How might He take away understanding?
  He will literally change our mind through natural processes.


18) Now, with some explanation of parables in general, Jesus exposits this one

19-23) Jesus shows us how to analyze a parable; note that He gives importance to many of the details in the parable - it's important to practice exegesis and gleaning rather than introduction
	General
		Soil represents a human heart

	The Path = one who hears and does not understand
		note the capability of the "evil one" to affect the transmission of Logos
	The Birds = servants of _the wicked one_
		[Jer 25]
	Rocky Ground = one who hears and immediately recieves it _with joy_
		has no root (root systems have depth and breadth)
		he _immediately_ falls away when being persecuted
		note: tribulation OR persecution; there are four different sources of trouble (your flesh, another's flesh, evil spirits)
	Thorny Ground = one who hears the word but is _unfruitful_
		cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches choke out the _fruit_
	Good Soil = one who hears the AND understands it
		bears fruit AND yields (multiplicative)
		[Heb 13:7]


34-35) He no longer spoke publically apart from parable


45-46) Pearls are
...not prized by Jews (except for their value in trade)
...the only gem made by a living organism
...created in response to an irritant
...removed from their natural habit to become and adornment
...taken out of their captivity in the [sea](/Pattern/Seas)
Matthew 14


15-21) This the only miracle recorded in all 4 gospels


22) Why did He dismiss the crowds?  Perhaps because He knew a storm was coming.
He also dismissed Israel for a couple millenia.
The disciples were tossed upon the [sea](/pattern/sea)
...akin to the Ark
Jesus was upon the mountain praying when the storm started.
- He is currently interceding for us
- The parallel implies that He will come to us when the storm peaks.
- [Is 5:14+] 'I will go and return...'
The disciples are not out of Jesus' reach - He walked to them.

28) A nice picture of salvation: Peter said 
1. "if it's You" ~ his idea of the Messiahs manifesting power was the ability to empower others
2. "tell me to come” ~ Peter had to step out

Matthew 15


3-6) The Jews had a legal mechanism for dedicating a gift _to the temple_ which they used to avoid giving it to another person.


12) The most learned, reputable men in their society were questioning the disciples' Master and it fretted them.

13-14) Those who oppose the truth will be rooted up and burned.

14) "ignore them" ~ we are directed to _not_ oppose bad teachers but let God deal with them

15-16) It's not really a parable is it?  Hence, the reason Jesus knows that Peter doesn't understand.

16-18) understanding, mouth, stomach -> feces
	...implying that such waste matter makes up the intentions of our heart
	[Jer 17:19] ~ heart = "incurably" wicked
	the heart is never fixed, it must be recreated
# Matthew 17


3) How did they know who the two were?  Spirit name-badges, or perhaps told later...
# Matthew 18

Forgiveness is not natural but supernatural: yet another evidence of Yahweh from the Church (hopefully).

3-4) Children are open-minded and dependent.
Children were 2nd-class citizens in that era: they're worth was ascribed by the father.


10) _Their_ angels
	childrens' guardian angels
	...and never out of the Father's sight


15-20) Pattern of restoration of lost siblings:
- 

33) had mercy ~ eleeeo = the act of mercy, compassion, or pity

# Matthew 19


16-17) Jesus starts the man by pointing Him toward the important truth for context: the incarnation displaying Yahweh's concern and standard

18-19) Jesus brilliantly leads the man in a tour of his predominant idols:
~ remember that Jesus holds us accountable for a thought as much as an act [Matt 5:27-28]
~ this is the point of Jesus' direction of this conversation 

21-22) Jesus unmasks what is keeping this man from God
[Ex 20:15] ~ God supports private property
...so, Jesus is not giving a prescription but outlining the idols that are foremost between him and Yahweh

23-24) per Matthew Henry: "considering all the difficulties involved it is miraculous that anyone comes to faith"

24) The _Eye of the Needle_ is not a door, as is oft propogated.  There is a knot called a camel which is impossible to be pulled through the eye of a needle around which it is wrapped...unless it is untied.

25) They believed that earthly success equated to heavenly favor (and vice versa)
# Matthew 2


Poor in spirit		<unsaved>		kingdom of heaven
Mourners			<losers>		comfort
Meek				<humble>		earth
Justice seeker		<angry>			satisfaction
Merciful			<servants>		mercy
Pure in heart		<unregretful>	see God
Peacemakers			<shepherd>		sons of God
Persecuted			<underdogs>		kingdom of heaven
Insulted			<slandered>		great reward in heaven


11) gold [Is 60:6]
frankincense [Ps 72:15]
myrrh [Jer 6:20]


23) [Is 53:2]()

# Matthew 20


1-16) kingdom of heaven _is like_ a master
	early morning
	hired laborers
	vineyard
		what is the vineyard? Israel?

	denarius ~= a fair day's wage

	can this really be about the Church? what's the wage? Bema seat rewards?

16) this naturally flows from the last verse of chapter 19


Prophet, Priest, and King

# Matthew 21


42) [Ps 118] ~ the same as that which they chanted in His triumphal entry

43) i.e. the fig tree

44) 2 choices: upon the stone, broken; under the stone, crushed
# Matthew 22


11-13) The garment is the salvation and faith of Christ
	_speechless_
	w/o a garment (which are provided by the Master) they are cast out


23-33) Jesus quotes only from the Pentateuch - which is the only scripture that the Sadducees hold as canonical

34) The Pharisees circled their wagons (defiance)
	in v.41 He goes to them


36-40) The summation
	[Deut 6:4] ~ the first table of the law
	[Lev 19:18] ~ the second table of the law

	carrying out these things requires supernatural influence


42) The ultimate question: What do you think about the Christ?
# Matthew 23


4) These are emotional and spiritual burdens that God never ordained
	the clergy never serves the laity

5-7) The acts of the clergy:
* Advertisement of deeds
* Advertisement of memory verse
* Advertisement of their works
* Taking the place of honor at communcal meals
* Taking the place of honor at assembly
* Love the title of teacher/preacher

13-35) 8 woes
13) Shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces
15) Propogate false doctrine
16-22) Oaths by the temple's gold
23-24)
25-26)
27-28)
29-30) 


37a)	The purpose of history

37b)	The tragedy of history

39)		The triumph of history
Matthew 24


14-30) Talents are given by God, we know from other scriptures that God gives the increase as well [1Cor 3:6-9].
Generosity is the lesson from the master: "I will set you over much."
Faithfulness is the reason for the gift.
Interesting that, no matter the quantity, it is considered "a little" by the Master.


24) 'if it were possible' - it's not, but will it prevent many elections?


37-39) parallel between Noah's flood and the final judgmentMatthew 25


1-13) Ten virgins
Partial Rapture: Lot is a type of the remnant/Church whereas he _had_ to be removed before the judgment could fall

14-30) Talents were highly valuable coinage
	even the single talent was not trivial
	he gave talents based on ability/skill

[Luke 19] ~ complementary, everyone gets the same amount

18) this seems like a natural, safe thing to do - but it turns out to an indefensible, punishable position


21,23) the joy of your Master
	[Zeph 3:17]
	

24-25) the man did not really know the Master
	the servant disregards/denies the Master's claim on the talent
	perhaps he was hiding his connection with the Master
	the wicked servant's talent is given the successful servant

25) part of Jesus purpose is to divide the earthly kingdom


29) the issue is responsibility: it begins with wealth given freely to us which naturally multiplies - unless it is hidden


31-46) Sheep N Goat Judgment
	[Ez 34:17] ~ judging between two types
	traditionally the goat on the left went to Yhwh, the other went off the cliff

34) 'from the foundation of the world'
		[Heb 4:3]
		[Is 40:21]
		[Rev 17:8]
		[1Kgs 7:9]
		[Matt 25:34]
		[Luke 11:50]
	 - as opposed to -
	'before the foundation of the world'
		[Eph 1:4] ~ defining the Church
		[John 17:24] ~ high priestly prayer
		[Rev 13:8]
		[1Pet 1:20]

41) the judgment prepared for the watchers is expanded to include the "goats"
Matthew 26


64) Jesus equates Hisself with Yahweh via [Dan 7:13-14]
# Matthew 27


35) We, also, his enemies, coveted his raiment


38) Two robbers
	[Is 53:12] [Luke 22:37]


[Ps 22]
[Ps 34:20]
[Is 52-53]

[Col 2:14]


51) the curtain was probably several inches thick and made of heavy, ornate fabric(s)
	[Acts 6:7]
# Matthew 28


16-20) 
nature vs. nurture is highly relevant in discipleship
- nature is where we were planted and this was a sovereign, creative act
- nurture is the circumstances arising all around
  - interactions with the natural world are providential
  - the free will of others in your life is also providential

18) exalt the savior

19) evangelize the sinner

20) edify the saint
observe ~ _tyrein_; keep the thing exactly as in [1Cor 7:37]
# Matthew 3


17)	Who is speaking?
		[Ps 2]
	"My beloved son" ~ a reference to Isaac, as a sacrifice; foreshadowing Jesus sacrifice
	"with whom I am well please" ~ [Isaiah 53;10]() about the suffering servant, who is an acceptable sacrifice
Matthew 4


## 3 Temptations

The devil did not offer Jesus acting He didn't right have already...if he wanted them
The devil tempted Jesus when we was weakened 


8) Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms saying, **"I will give thee"**
# Matthew 5


1-12) The Beatitudes
He is teaching his disciples, in seclusion.
"up on the mountain" is somewhat unusual for an ancient person; most mountains are not readily accessible without significant technology and they were considered the abode of the gods.


2) The fact that he _opened his mouth_ to teach them implies a personal, physical Christ connection.


3-12) Each line of this poem contains a demographic descriptor and a resultant condition.
It is left to the reader to fill in the blank: what causes that type of person to achieve the mentioned status?

|vs|Who|Transform|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|3|Poor in Spirit|Promotion|Rulership in Kingdom of Heaven|
|4|Mourners|Comfort|Comforted|
|5|Meek|Appointment|Inheritance of Earth|
|6|Protestor|Justice|Satisfication|
|7|Merciful|Grace|Mercy|
|8|Pure|Translation|Theosis|
|9|Peacemakers|Elevation|Rulership|
|10|Martyrs|Salvation|Membership in Kingdom of Heaven|
|11|Persecuted|Salvation|Ownership of Heaven|


13) divided loyalties make a person worthless
	a rhetorical question: salt cannot become less salty, it can only be diluted, unless it is utterly destroyed (chemically or nuclearly)

	salt-rocks used for baking or meat storage would eventually be leeched of salt and lose their effectiveness

	diluted salt is thrown away because it no longer A) has flavor or B) acts as a preservative

	note: in that day pure table salt was uncommon;


14) the Church is plainly visible


15) not only is hiding a lamp ineffective...but dangerous


16) we ought to be on display ~ in such a way the God is glorified



37) Biblical support for digital communications :)



43-48) This is the illucidation of perfection: love your enemies


46) Remember who wrote the book!  Matthew is surely writing about hisself - a true humility which can only come from the Spirit


48) This is not possible under our own power!
	You must take on His righteousness [Eph 2:7-8]
Matthew 7


1-5) Plankeye

6-12) Valuing others
6) The point of the pearls is expounded in v.11; Yahweh does not give gifts lightly:
  He gives better gifts than us
  He gives to those "who ask"

9-11) An implication?  Bread & fish are good (Logos & believers) vs. stone & serpent.
  Bread ~ Logos | Falsity ~ Stone
  Fish ~ People | Devils ~ Snake

12) The rub = gift people similarly


23) The word _never_ is so important here: He is speaking to people He never knew - workers of lawlessness - unbelievers.


28-29) People recognize the truth in place of the same rhetoric.
Matthew 8


10) Jesus marveled - this is something to pay attention to.


31-32)	Why did they ask?
		Why did Jesus grant it?
		...perhaps to demonstrate our capacity for evil
		[Jam 2:19]
Matthew 9


18-26) The Jewish girl and the Gentile woman
	girl was 12, woman was sick for 12yr.

20) Jesus, on His way to raise the Jew, healed the Gentile

Matthew

Written just before 70AD


1. genealogy,  angelic announcement
2. foreign Kings,  prophecies fulfilled
3. anointing
4. the opening battle


Matthew references more prophecy than the other gospels.


8) "These Things Done"
What is right: Justice and morality, contextually - not for gain but for it's own sake; not karma but the application and proximity of the Holy Spirit

Love Mercy: we easily love being the recipient of Mercy but do we love it's application by us and the opportunity to do so?

Walk humbly: He wants you besides Him but never forget that He is holy and you are not (unless He makes you so.)
# Micah 6


2) mountains ~ i.e. the abode of gods;
    hills ~ i.e. lesser, perhaps synthetic, gods

3) God's plea: are you _seriously_ tired of my ways?

4) I saved you

5) Even the pagan "prophets" cannot help but proclaim me

6) yearling ~ i.e. a sacrifice _for_ justice
    ram ~ i.e. a sacrifice _for_ justification
    oil ~ i.e. an offering _for_ mercy
Nehemiah 9

6-8) You
	LORD
	alone
	made heaven
	preserve them
	worshipped
	LORD God chooser
	finder
	covenanter
	promise keeper (reserver)

9-15) You
	saw affliction, announced deliverance
	# Nehemiah 1


7) 3 things violated:
commandments
statutes
rules

# Nehemiah 10


19) Anathoth
	Jeremiah was from Anathoth
	[Jer 32:7+]	he purchased the field of Anathoth
	[Rev 5:1] ~ the title deed
# Nehemiah 13


4-9) Tobiah was given a portion of sacred space for his dwelling "in the courts of the house of God."
...but he did not belong there
# Nehemiah 2


6) Apparently this was an intimate setting (because the queen would not normally be present at a formal function)
This is Queen Damaspia
# Nehemiah 3


27) Tekoi was the hometown of Amos [Amos 1:1]
...perhaps a culture of worship existed there that fathered a prophet as well as wall-builders
# Nehemiah 5


7) Sometimes it is necessary, when leading, to circumvent those leaders who do not provide counsel


12) Nehemiah required accountability of the leadership
Nehemiah 7


Many of the cities listed herein are in _northern_ Israel.
All 12 tribes are represented here.


[Ezra 6:19-22]
# Nehemiah


Book occurs about 445 - 425BC

478BC ~ Esther


Leadership Lessons:

	Mission Driven
	Patience (prayed for 4 months)
	Respected authority
	Constant prayer
	Didn't argue
	Wasn't discouraged
	Used what he had (position and materiel)
	Didn't take abuse or take advantage of his position

An interesting sidelight in [Dan 9:25]
	Nehemiah's book details the rebuilding of the city (Ezra set out to rebuild the temple)
Numbers 35


Cities of Refuge

6) the Levites 6 cities
	permit a manslayer to escape thereto
	an additional 42 cities (non-refuges)

7) 48 Levitical cities

8) cities reapportioned propotionaly from the other tribes

9) Yahweh _spoke_ to Moses

10)

11) the manslayer (unintentional) may flee to these cities and live
	- until he stands before the congregational judgment

12) a refuge from what? the avenger of blood
	- again, no death until the congregational judgement

13) 6 cities
	of refuge

14) 3 beyond the Jordan River
	3 in Canaan

15) for Israelites
	for sojourners

16) no refuge for murderers
	iron

17) no murderers
	stone

18) no murderers
	wood

19) the avenger of blood exacts revenge

20-21) hate = murder
	again, up to the avenger of blood

22-24) accidents are forgiven

25) *** the refugee shall dwell in refuge until _the High Priest dies_


28) after the High Priest dies the refugee returns to 'the land of his possession'
Numbers 2


population per tribe
	laying out tribes by area in the four cardinal directions yields a cross

camp placements corresponds with the arrangment of the [Seraphim]
Numbers 21


brass serpent ~ {John 3:14}
	this was later destroyed by Hezekiah because it became a fetish
# Numbers 24


17) "star out from Jacob" ~ celestial language about believers.
...hearkens back to [Gen 37:9]

Also, Jesus [in a sense] passed the scepter from the Jews [ethnic] to the Church [sociological]
...the Jewish leadership of Jesus day was riven because they thought that the scepter had departed from Judah because the Romans had usurped their right to deliver capital punishment.
# Numbers 29

12-34) The 71 bulls
It is not coincidence that there 70 nations in [Gen 11] & Jesus sends out 70 disciples in [Luke 10]
The 70 bulls are a commemoration of Yahweh's continual victory over the nations
The next bull is the sacrifice _to_ Yahweh

1st day ~	15th day of the 7th month
			13 bulls, v.13
2nd day ~	12 bulls, v.17
3rd day ~	11 bulls, v.20
4th day ~	10 bulls, v.23
5th day ~	9 bulls, v.26
6th day ~	8 bulls, v.29
7th day ~	7 bulls, v.32
8th day ~	1 bull	(solemn assembly), v.36


[Zech 14:16] The LORD fights the nation, stands on the Mount of Olives, complete victory and transformation of the cosmos, yearly Sukot festival [Rev 20]

[Amos 9:11-12] [Acts 15]
Numbers 30


Jesus did observe our vow of allegiance to the world (via sin) and opposed it.
Thereby the Father forgives [12].
Numbers 6


1) Yahweh via Moses

2) all the people were told of the convictions of these few
	ר'זנ = nezer ~ dedicated (vows the vows of dedicated to be dedicated)
	! man or woman
	for sanctification

3) separate
	no wine
	no strong drink
	no wine vinegar
	no spirits vinegar
	no grape juice
	no grapes
		fresh or dried

4) nothing from the grapevine
	interesting parallel with being separated from The Vine
	...not partaking of any fruit thereof

5) no head hairs cut during separation
	he (she v. 2) shall be holy during separation
	the hair will grow long

6) no proximity to corpses during separation
	does that include whitewashed tombs?

7) no breaking the vow even for close family
	"the separation to God is on his head"
	...the hair is an emblem

8) reiterating the holiness of separation

9) again with defiling the head
	~ indicative of Christ
	~ something about head-hair + dead-body ???
		requires shaving

10-12) remittance and do-over for defiling the vowed

13) brought up to the tabernacle at the completion of his days

14) bring offerings
	burnt
	sin
	peace

15) bring some yummy breads
	bring guilt offerings
	bring drink offerings	(sacrifice of service {2Tim 4:6})

16-17) the presentation via a priest

18) shaving the hair
	used to fuel the fire for the peace offering
Philippians 1


9-11) Maturity:
Abound in love for God
Abound in love for people
Approve excellence
Appear sincere & blameless
Abide in Christ


18) What if Christ is preached only out of pretense and tradition?  Hallelujah, let Christ be preached

19) Don't we all have appetites?  Can they be redeemed?  To that end: a man is tilt revealed by his appetites.


# Philippians 4


17) giving is an investment; and it is good to seek the profit thereof

Philippians 2


"Your are far worse than you could ever imagine;  You are far more loved than you could ever perceive"

3) This is the antidote for selfishness and and unloving heart: "count other more significant than yourselves"
This begins the greatest testimony: that Christ did this.  He is greater than all yet was humbled more than all.


5-11) _this mind_ is available via Christ
Christ did not seek after superiority but sought humility.
Proverbs 1


7) FotL


12) the grave takes people alive and it takes people whole
  Those who even have a glimmer of life are not taken
  ...by implication we, who were dead before meeting Christ, were completely dead - there was no good in us


29) FotL
  fearing the LORD is a choice, 


33) listen to wisdom
  - dwell secure
  - be at ease
  - no dread of disaster
Proverbs 10


Just increase comes through righteousness of deed and speech


19) just the act of talking can be sinful
  we can't help but, eventually, sin if we keep our mouths running
  restraint is evidence of wisdom
  ...even an apt word can be too much

20) They implication here is that words are of & from the heart.

21) Words can nourish or starve.
Which depends on the intent of the speaker 
The implication is that we need communication to survive.

Words should be:
  True
  Helpful
  Inspiring [Ps 103]
  Necessary
  Kind


24) Self-fulfilling prophecies: 
  Fear ~ tragedy
  Hope ~ fulfillment


29) It is the believers lifestyle and attitude that keeps them from trouble.
This is from Yehovah, not a man-mafe thing.
He shapes us.
This same lifestyle displaces evil, not just from our lives, but from neighbors.
Proverbs 11

Wise & unwise leadership 


3) integrity is a guide, it leads because it disallows us from taking certain paths


6) notice the plural: the upright have a collective righteousness and freedom; similarly, the evil are bound in their collective lust


13) Slander = telling secrets.
This is the most basic requirement for leaders.


21) God is just - thank God that the Father's righteousness can cover the child (and thank Jesus for the sacrifice that made that possible)


27) goodness = seeking acceptance  {Gal 5:22}
Proverbs 12


12) You can predict the outcome of an action based on the disposition of the heart beforehand.  Likewise, you can retroactively gauge the heart by the outcome.  The question is: what really constitutes destruction or honor?


14) We should be fruit inspectors - of ourselves and others [Heb 13:7]()


17) This is so basic, more definition than proverb.  We should not despise the one who speaks truth in honesty.   And lies cannot be given with wholesome motives; so-called "white" lies are even designed to evoke political gain.


22) what is faithful action?  honesty and goodness are implied here...
Proverbs 13


1) Oh, to be a wise man!


7) does everyone pretend?  perhaps now but not always, i.e. Jesus 1st and 2nd comings
  

11) perseverance; wealth may be money or knowledge or skill 


22) I wish to leave such to my progeny: both spiritual and physical wealth, to both natural and spiritual children 
Proverbs 14


5) people are not known by degrees of honesty, they are honest or not, liars or not
  the Word is completely true, false Scripture is lie after lie


23) unless your job is to talk, words are generally wasteful 

24) wise living naturally tends to wealth


33) "wisdom rests _quietly_ in the heart of MoA"
    ...but it becomes more and more obvious when surrounded by less and less wisdom
Proverbs 15


21) the fool enjoys wandering aimlessly, achieving nothing
  the MoA has a goal and strives for it


31) ignorance = self-loathing
  We can gain willpower by listening
Proverbs 16


7) Oh, to be wise!  I'd rather have an enemy shake their head than swing their sabre...


14) the messenger of death _passes over_
  The only true appeasement is The Blood


31) gray hair = stress ~ righteous life = stressful
    ...gained, as in wealth or scars
Proverbs 17


4) what you listen to reveals your character


6) [crown] ~ עטרה / atarah
  [glory] ~ תפארה / tipharah


16) the answer to the rhetorical is: he shouldn't.  there must be some sense, some atemporal, non-action that precedes salvation; something that opens us to the Spirit.

17) Love is at the heart of everything always.


19) We perpetuate our guilt, through sin, as the norm.
We tend to exalt ourselves and that pride brings downfall.
Proverbs 18


1) pride and fear isolate
  the selfless man seeks unity
  isolation is a reckless course
  
  
5) we are all wicked and in need of mercy
...but it is appropriate to apply standards in the conduct of kingdom work


23) spiritual riches are not necessarily good - those who are physically wealthy may be poor in spirit {Matt 5:3}
Proverbs 2

1) "if you accept" ~ the first step is desire


4) seek it like silver ~ what is it about silver mining?
Dig up ore, crush and separate, smelt, refine.
We should be about mining and not prospecting (always searching for new claims). 

5) understand fear, without fear of the LORD there can be no faith
  without fear there is no courage


7) store = ???? ~ hide away, keep safe.  God saves wisdom for the elect.


16-19) Interesting that this woman to avoid is married with children.  Not condoning pre-marital sex: but the ancient definition of adultery was sex with a married/betrothed woman.

Proverbs 20


1) strong drink will sap an entire night of potential productivity


8) A powerful king drives away fleeting vapidity with scarcely a glance


13) don't אהב ~ have an appetite for, sleep
  simply open the eyes to see, and attain, the nourishment already available


21) e.g.  being promoted beyond one's station without merit


24) We can't fully understand our path and we're walking it.  However, we can often look back and see where we've been steered around deadly traps and trained for difficult crossings.
Proverbs 21


12) what happens in your home is the true measure of you {Matt 6:6}


21) pursue
  tsedaqah ~ righteousness, chesed ~ benignity
  chay ~ life, kavod ~ glory


23) 'keep' the tongue and mouth
Proverbs 22


1) Reputation and influence, not money, are the root of power.  Likewise, reputation without influence is worthless - and vice versa.
Application: tell someone, honestly, something they are good at and ask them how you can be better at it as well.


6) Train up ~ active, deliberate
Child ~ Must be done to/for kiddos
Even When ~ forecasting the inevitable
Not Depart ~ we are forever, indomitably driven by our training
...good training is impossibly hard to overcome


20) 30 = the divinely perfect number
  Counsel = a helper (ours is threefold and omnipresent)
  Knowledge = facts and learning, useful information

21) right ~ correct/proper which implies a standard
  true ~ implies an absolute and a source
  
  "those who sent you"?  This is the believer acting as agent and ambassador of God.


29) skills are learned (unlike talents)
He will (not)
...an absolute, present tense, God places us where we should be.
  The practicing is up to us, the circumstances bringing us to the palace are up to God.  God does not relegate us to obscurity because that is not the gospel.  
Proverbs 23


26) Give me your heart...why?  To be saved from predators.
Proverbs 24.txt


9) even to think about foolishness is sin...how lost we all are!  And how much greater is His mercy when even thoughts can be sin.Proverbs 25


6-7a) never _take_ your place, let it be given to you
  the Lord places us for purposes of training and example
  do what you are told to do, He will resolve issues
  remember that you are the adopted, rebellious child of no estate

15) quiet tenacity works wonders...even with God - He can be persuaded and still be sovereign 
  well spoken words must be well planned

16-17) You may truly be a sweet fellow but do not over-indulge.


28) Interesting, the link between boundaries and self-control.  Establishing and maintaining appropriate boundaries is part of self-control.  This is not always keeping others out but, also, staying within it ourselves.
Proverbs 26


16) we always make excuses for our apathy
   Even legitimate excuses are invalid


18-19) Satan has become psychotic in the rebellion {Eph 6:16}
  we would as well


23) Fervency does not mean necessity.  In fact fervency is like dressing over wickedness.

24-26) The Hater
  LORD, cure me of my hatred to avoid that humiliation!
Proverbs 27


2) never sing your own praises
  of a stranger praises you he sees true value, even if selfishly


13) like the garment of the house of Judah was held... Only God could redeem it.


19) we can know ourselves, to an extent, by our heart
  the implication is that we can know others
  {Ex 23:19} - be merciful to a brother and wary of a hypocrite


21) a person is tested by their game ~ is Apollo about perception, do they realize where it comes from?
Proverbs 29


17) a good son shares in the labor
  a good son helps achieve unity
  

21) in that case, we must have been pampered and wooed from birth - because we have been made heirs {Rom 8:17}


25) We are trapped by our fear of non-Godly things - the antidote of which is a thorough realization that our King is ultimately in charge.
[1PET 3:5-6]
Proverbs 31


1)	Who is Lemuel?  Some sources say that htis is a pet-name for Solomon; which would make the narrator Bathsheba...hmm...  Other sources say this is a non-Israeli Jewish king.


4-5) a leader cannot afford to anesthetize hisself, else he become incapable of leading 
Proverbs 9


verse) number="5" topic="mixed wine"
  contrast with {Proverbs 23:29}


7) and yet...Jesus did it anyway
  He thought the abuse and injury to be worth it


12) behavior effects the behaver more than the object
There are four audiences of this book:
- The fool
- The simple
- The scoffer
- The wise

Performing the prescriptions of this book will create good tendencies.

Delighting in the prescriptions of this book gives understanding and discernment.

No other book so elegantly expounds the way of Christ.

5,9) False witness, like Naboth's accusers, will suffer
  Liars will cannot escape their own snare, neither can they live in the end.
  
  
7) People hate the poor and needy, thank God that He does not!
We are all poor and needy in spirit.


9) 


10) We can run "into" His name by invoking it and {Ex 21:7} standing under it


18) God knows how many stumbles it will take us to walk right
  {Deut 21:18+} - we rebels deserved death, but He pardoned us
  Thank God for His discipline.

19) This is especially important for someone being groomed toward leadership: we are no longer servants of Christ upon salvation, we are brothers.  [John 15:15]()
  A brother and friend __can__be disciplined by words because the heart is involved and emotion cements the lesson.

22) what does it take to be a real man?  steadfast love

23) fear of God = rest and satisfaction 
  ...we feel the hand and try to see the face
  ...no harm to those who fear the LORD?  Now?


30) rebuke is like hydrogen-peroxide, it destroys rotten and foreign flesh
  {Heb 12:11}
  
Proverbs 28


7) the understanding son does right
  the shameful son _consorts_ with worthless people
  ...since our worth comes from Christ, this implies an association with anti-christian people


10) to mislead is to set a trap, there is always a goal in leadership
  mislead = שגה ~ ravishing, taking advantage
  blameless = תמימ ~ sincerity 


19) talk is cheap
  'a servant' not just anyone, implies the believer
  Words are enough for understanding
  ...but not enough for discipline
  ...they can be ignored
Proverbs 3


3) we can, and ought to, deliberately seek to attain faithfulness and love
  {Gal 6:22} ... be faithful, be loving
  tying them on refers [partly] to the Jewish t'fillin


5) "your own understanding" is limited and faulty ~ a sample size of you is not a population

9-10) the promise of plenty is doubled: food and drink 
  The impetus for gaining wealth is to remember the LORD 1st in an increase
  ...i.e. on payday the first payment is the tithe and we do it as an act of worship


21) Maintenance means practice, honing and using skills.


27) Duty to man.  To whom is good due?  Are we obliged to serve all?  If so, it can only be because of imago dei - we have no other innate worthiness.
Proverbs 30


4) His name is Yahweh and His son's name is Yeshua.


8) l'chem choq = לחמ חקי ~ feed me my portion


11-14) 4 of those...marks of evil
  Parents
  Hygiene
  Pride
  Slander
  ...don't be one of those

11) praise your father and bless your mother
Proverbs 4


5) wisdom = the right exercise of knowledge
  insight = knowledgeable, skilled insight
  don't forget ~ daily refreshment 
  don't turn away ~ don't disregard commands


14-15) the path of wickedness
  Don't enter it
  Don't walk on it
  Avoid it
  Don't go on it
  Turn away from it
  Pass on
Proverbs 5


17) an admonition against 'swinging'
Proverbs 6


6) this is the call: not come, but go
  because He is with us (omnipresence) the call is not relative to Him, but got the world 
  the unrighteous should consider the righteous
    it is the lazy who bear no fruit
    {Matt 25:14-30}
  wisdom can come via consideration ~ pre-application


9-11) our propensity for laziness affects everything
  We it designed to need rest, but how much is too much
  The ant toils without direct leadership - this really is a fundamental behavior, a change of mind
Proverbs 7

2) How many of us actually guard our eyes?
  The fool does not
  The scoffer does the opposite
  The simple does not
  The wise man does proactively


26) you are not the only victim
  the one who is willing to fornicate (physically and/or spiritually) has no qualms and few boundaries
  her victims are humiliated and are many ~ but they are now the עצמים (mighty)
  The adulteress, as an office, does not have only one victim.
Proverbs 8


22) possessed ~ קנה = buy/acquire


25) The mountains were purpose-built, not random acts of violent processes.


29) what we these markings of the foundation(s)

30) beside Him ~ implies omnipresence (which implies dignity)
  master workman ~ wisdom actually accomplished high-level things
  daily delight ~ routine?  implies the pre-planning of rhythm and cycle which are god
  wisdom brings joy, always (as does its means האשנ כדש)


34) listen, not just hearing by synthesizing
  where are His gates?
  where are His doors?

35-36) The ways to respond to wisdom:
accept ~ life & favor
war ~ injury
reject ~ death
Psalm 12
	1-2) why we need Scripture
		expecting/anticipating God's intervention
	3-4) the opposition
		empty talkers (Titus 1)
		people expecting to enact
	5) because ___
		I will:
			arise
			place him (you)

	6) pure words
		silver ~ blood, foundational
		"of the Earth" imagine the Word being tried and proven in men
    'the Revelation of God is the holy blood proven in the lives of men'
		7x ~ completeness

	7-8) God's responsibility
		keeping
		guarding
			from the wicked and vile
Psalm 122

Psalm 125

Assurance
  {Rom 8:38+
  {John 10:27+}

Zion
  unlike Sinai, we can walk upon Zion
  {1Chr 11}
  {Heb 12:22}

1) fact of security

2) foundation of security

3) reassurance of security
  no evil is permanent, it's threat is invalid

4) prayer of security
Psalm 129

8) to no longer dwell in a land where people's hearts turn to God = the ultimate oppression
Psalm 130

Is this a lament or a praise?  Yes.

2) The psalmist is drowning and recognizes His innate need.

3) a recognition that we cannot stand before the holiness of יהוה
  Ultimately יהוה is the one wronged by all sins.  "If damnation be justice, then mercy may choose its own object." Johnathan Edwards

4) why is God's goodness a reason to fear Him?
  {Hos 3:5} - fear that He will extract from us the payment due to Him
  {Col 1:17} - it is only His ongoing momentary will that preserves us
  {Ps 51:4}

Psalm 132


{2Sam 6-7}
{Haggai}


1-5) an oath

Psalm 133


'brothers' is first used of Abraham and Lot

quarreling amongst family is a given and is seen throughout the Bible


{1Chr 12:38}
  perhaps the event inspiring this Psalm


Our truest example of unity is the Trinity
  {John 17}
  
Prophetic usage of this pattern
  [Romans 15]()


1) brothers ~ genetic and spiritual
two unities ~ 
  factual ~ members together in the Church
  practical ~ no gossip, no retreat
good ~ echoes of the sixth day {Gen 1}
pleasant ~ enjoying the shared Spirit

2) {Ex 30:22,31} holy anointing oil
  ~ used for consecration
The priest is saturated with the holy stuff
...so, unity is like being showered in holiness

3) Mt. Hermon, tall and far too the north, the source of life-giving waters
Yahweh has commanded the blessing of unity
~ give it = share your gifts
~ receive it = invest time

{Php 2:1}


Several examples of brothers whose lines are destined to reconcile:
- Shem, Japheth, Ham
- Isaac, Ishmael

Psalm 134

# Psalm 18

25-26) The way God presents Himself
Psalm 19

1-6) the attributes of heaven, general revelation
1)	heavens
	sky
2)	day
	night

  What used to be worshipped as gods, the heavenly bodies, are actually creations. 

  i.e. Romans 1
	

7-9) the attributes of Scripture and their effects, special revelation

  ties to Matt 5 beatitudes

7)	perfect ~ revival
	sure ~ wizening
8)	righteous ~ rejoicing
	pure ~ enlightening
9)	clean ~ enduring
	true ~ righteous alTOGETHER (Jn 17:21)

Psalm 37


1) just don't do it...easier decreed than pursued

2) _soon_ ~ a promise from the Master
	fade ~ no lingering memories or influence
		like grass, wilted, drained of life, ugly
	wither ~ brought low and robbed of nourishment
		the green herb is dried, crushed, and eaten
		in hopes of them seeking true nourishment

3) trust in the LORD, who else?  have we not yet submitted to His sovereignty?
	dwell in the land ~ stand your ground?  do not let others disregard you [Tit 2:16]
	faithfulness ~ by Grepthar's hammer...
		befriend it, keep it close, honor it
		stay close to the faithful, let them rub off

4) delight yourself in the LORD, the promise keeper, the creator, He who is sovereign even over carpal tunnel syndrome
	desires
		[Matt 6:33]
		[Eccl 1:2]
		[1Tim 6:6]
		[1Jon 2:15-17] ([John 2:15-17])
		[John 4:13-14]

5) command: commit your way to the LORD
	let Him pave the way, give you dreams, heal & sustain
	trust in Him ~ no one was ever so faithful or trustworthy as the Covenanter Hisself
	_and_ He will act.  He acts in response to the testimony

6) bring forth - from where?  like carving off a piece of Christ's garment custom fit for me...?
	_your_ righteousness, gifted;  not His any longer but truly given to us from His infinite wealth of goodness
	_your_ justice; yikes!  I don't want justice, I want mercy!
	It's a good thing these happen in this order; if we weren't righteous by the time His justice arrived we would be burned up.


24) {Acts 1:18}


33) him = who?; LORD does not abandon a believer to their own strength - which is, essentially, negligible;. Note does He abandon the wicked when there is a glimmer of hope for their salvation.



# Psalm 49

7-9) Indeed only a divine sacrifice could pay a man's life's ransom.


11) Even though they name streets after themselves, their final home is the grave
Psalm 73


1)	
	pure implies purification
	...those who look to God and his followship
2)	feet stumbling ~ walk faltering
	steps slipping ~ 
3)	an old question: why do the wicked prosper?
	Ps 37:38,92:7 ~ the wicked are doomed
	...their currency is ordained for God's purposes

16)	wearisome ~ exhausting mentally/spiritually
17)	1Cor 3:16 ~ the sanctuary in us
	God gives discernment
	...about the future of the wicked
18)	Ps 35:6 ~ God places them on slippery surfaces and offers a nudge
19)	someday the wicked will be taken away in a moment by the terrors
20)	the next life will make this one seem like a faint dream
	Yahweh rouses Hisself and then despises them 'as phantoms'
	...how does God despise phantoms?
21)	embittered soul
	oweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee# Psalm 84



2) the psalmist is desperate


8) the psalmist _hears_; God is asked to _speak_ (give ear, )


10) the psalmist percieves God's house as greater than all others

11) God is the provider of all good: physical, moral, and mental
13) Righteousness is like the prophetic announcement of where God is going.
Matthew Henry: "to raise our expectations of his favour and to qualify us for it"
When we see righteousness evolve in another it is Yahweh working in them as a prelude to greater works.
Psalm 9


5-6) e.g. the Antichrist nor his cohorts are ever named - because the eternal Logos will not be blotted 
  ...in a sense, their names are already blotted out

  Cyrus _is_ named in Isaiah - i.e. he was a believer
Psalm 98


1) a new song requires focus and/or inspiration
  your own new song has some inspiration and requires work to bring to fruition 
  the new song of another also requires focus and a desire to learn
We ought to easily find inspiration in our LORD because He is infinitely amazing

# Psalm 1

1) Body positioning is important.


Interesting symettry:

1,3)
1.walk - 2.yielding fruit
2.stand - 1.planted
3.sit - 3.prosper

Righteous path:
1. Be planted and stand
    a. Where you are right now.  A tree really can't move itself.  God puts it near a nutrient source.
    b. In the shape you are in
2. Yield fruit
    a. Not creating but purposely allowing, the sense of timing based on properties
    b. Not prematurely, having patience
    c. Not late, when the ripeness is gone
3. Leaf unwithering
    a. The leaf can't cause itself not to wither: it is totaly dependent on the branch, thereby the trunk [vine]. [John 15:5]
# Psalm 103


The benefits of the LORD:
- forgiveness
- healing
- redemption
- promotion

Psalm 115


3-8) similar to [Ps 135:13-18]

8) You become like what you worship

2)	keep ~ first attained, then stored away

We have to become fed up with the world to truly appreciate the graciousness of God's economy.

"If only..."culture
  We, the immature, believe that only one more thing will bring peace.  The world purposely does not satisfy; "One Big Lie."  God alone satisfies.

1) remembering God's prior Faithfulness

2) falsehood personified

3) arrow wound = death in that era
      {Ps 64:3}
    Broom tree = a weed
    Broom wood = long burning
      {Jam 6:4}

4) 

5) Meshech = Russia, Kedar = Arabia
  Living in a foreign land
  "Woe is me" ... I am become one of them {Is 6:5}

6) when lightning flashes over a night road the fool looks at the lightning, the wise man looks at the road (to see the way)

Psalm 121


Keeper of me, my Guardian

{Luk 2:41+}  Jesus'family made this trip


4) God never stops His redemption work
  He is our guardian

5) He is as inseparable as my shadow.
What do I need shaded from?  from the glory of Yahweh.  The only eternal danger we face is His disintegrating holiness.

Psalm 123

probably written by Hezekiah when surrounded and confronted by Assyrians
  {2Kgs 18-19}
  {Is 37-39}

1) 'lift' ~ present tense
  ...any look to God will be upwards 
  'enthroned' ~ then, now, always

2) the fearful hand, it could crush or maim...but it did not
  ...needful
  'til He has mercy'  the expectant hope of the believers
  
3-4) contempt
  they hate Him and us 

3) the call for mercy must be specifically addressed: יהוה

4) 'more than enough'
  tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go, tired of wasting breath, tired of nothing left

{Heb 12:1-3} ~ adopt the posture of spiritual worship {Rom 12:1}
...be fixatedPsalm 124


{2Sam 5:17-21}

4) oriental floods, in wadi's, are surges

7) the snare broken - how unlikely!
  Further unlikely because it was set with skill by the fowler

8) His credentials are impressive



2) Divine economy = rest first then work
  It's not that I'm not beloved but that I've stepped away from it.

3) the fruit is not a result of work

4) arrows are precisely launched

5) natural and spiritual children
The Gate ~ the seat(s) of power; we ought to prepare our children to go there


Psalm 135


13-18) similar to [Ps 115:3-8]

18) You become like what you worship
Psalm 22

The power of this prayer is in the naming of circumstances and conditions.
..."makes them visible for remedy" Kathleen O'Connor


1-19) Lament and recount ~ raw emotion

3) Yahweh dwells in the fruit of our lips - lives of praise


12) ~ the leaders of the realms of the dead (Bashan)
Bashan ~ Aramaic for "snake", the rulers of the serpent's land; [Deut 3:10-11]()


19) We make it over halfway through the song before a request is made.

19-21) Requests:
- Come
- Deliver
- Save


26) Seekers are not rewarded with answers but with joy.


29) Every knee will bow [Is 45:23](Is 45:23)


The psalmist is assuming that God knows what to do 


Jesus quotes this psalm from the cross - not as a prophetic fulfillment but as a paradoxical identification with we who suffer.


2) Green pastures ~ [Mark 6:39]()


4) The rod/staff represents the Shepherd's power.
The staff crook could be used to rescue by hooking around the neck.
Shepherds would count the sheep as they passed under their rod.

# Psalm 3

1-2) David's enemies are not only trying to kill him but are challenging his very identity.

3) "a shield" 
- a shield is for soldiers, those going into combat
- Yahweh's shield covers all around, not just in front

"my glory" ~ implies that another thing can be _my glory_
# Psalm 30

1b) This is the summation of God's character.
Psalm 51


8) this may have been an inspired addition seeing that the walls didn't need rebuilding until after the exile.


12) This is grace: that we are not caused to do a thing but given the means to do a thing.  Notice that a willing Spirit is before a Spirit of power: without willingness there can be no power.  

13) This is how we validate a ministry: does is reach and teach the lost.

# Psalm 7

11+) God is angry every day.
He even prepares to end the lives of the evil.
But evil takes care of it's own.

5-6) When taken in the context of contemporaneous source texts these are actually names or pseudonyms for demonic entities known in antiquity.
	Dever & Resheph [Hab 3:5]Songs of Ascent

Psalms 120-134

"songs for the road"
  these accompanied the journey up to the temple
  the journey was literally 'upward' geographically and spirituallyRevelation 1


24 titles are given which are used throughout the book (like a dictionary)

	priests		death
	kings		return

17a) the believer fell as thou dead

17b)

17c-18) "fear not" because He is first and last?
	because He is the Living One (why is this caps?)
	He dies and now lives = Divinity
	He absolutely controls Death and Hades
		the end of universal life
		the abode of the dead

19) things that:
	1) you have seen
	2) those that are
	3) those that are to take place after this
	?past, present, future?
Revelation 13


1)	beast, 10 horns ~ Daniel 9
		diadem on each horn
	seven head
		each with a blasphemous name
2)	beast ~ leopard
		bear feet
		lion mouth
		dragon's power
		dragon's throne
		great authority (from dragon)
3)	"one of it's heads"
		'seemed' ~ mortally wound
		...healed
		...earth marveled & followed
4)	'and' worshipped the dragon
	...because he gave authority to the beast
		"Who is like the beast?"
		"Who can fight against God?"
5)	Daniel 7:5
	beast _given_ a mouth
	...uttering haughtiness & blasphemies
	beast was _allowed_ to exercise authority
		42 months = 3.5yrs

	Jer 15:2
	Jer 43:11
	Gen 9:6
	endurance = accept Providence
Revelation 17


The 7 are kingdoms in succession
	#6 was Rome
The 10 are concurrent nations/kingdoms

2) sexual immorality with the _kings of the earth_

4) the seductress


6) _drunk with blood_ exactly parallels the blood-drinking cannibal giants of The Book of Enoch

7)	the angel spoke
	...don't marvel (explanation forthcoming)
		explaining
			the mystery of the woman
			the mystery of the beast w/ 7 heads, 10 horns
	Rev 13, Dan 7
8)	the beast
		existed, but not now
		about to rise from the bottomless pit
		about to goto the destruction
	earth-dwellers who are not sealed/saved
	...marvel to see the beast
		_because_ it existed, but not now, ?but they knew it was coming?
	the implication is that the saved were known "from the foundation of the world"
9)	"calls for...wisdom"
	7 heads = 7 mountains
		mountains are types of kingdoms
		...so, probably not Rome in the end but an homage to the Roman-beastly heritage
		...v.10) 5 are fallen (means five prior kingdoms)
		the woman is seated on the 7
10)	7 kings
		5 "fallen" (dead)
			Tarquin Kings: 753-510 BC
			Counsulors: 510-494 BC
			Plebians/Dictators: 494-390 BC

11)	beast (existed but not now)
		an 8th belonging to the 7
			8th ~ horn; 7th ~ mountain/kingdom
		...and it goes to destruction
12)	10 horns = 10 kigns
	...have not yet received royal power
	...will receive authority for 1 hour
		together with the beast
		1hr idiomatic of ???
13)	all kings are single-minded (i.e. against God)
	willingly give their authority to the beast
14)	the kings make war on the Lamb
	...the Lamb conquers them
		for He is Lord of lords/King of kings
		those with Him are chosen & faithful
Revelation 19

7-8) clothed in fine linen; like the high priest on Yom Kippur

9)	a command from an angel ('the' angel?)
	"Write this"
		Word delivered via messenger
		1. Blessed are the invitees
		2. the true words of God

10)	Even in his wizened christianity John mistakes the situation.
	the angel is faithful :)
	a _fellow_ servant
		with John
		with his brothers (who hold to the testimony of Jesus)
	an angelic redirection: Worship God
	The purpose of all Scripture:
		The testimony of Jesus is _the spirit of prophecy_
		all Scripture is prophetic
		[Ps 119]
			vs. 14, 22, 24, 31, 36, 46, 59, 79, 88, 95, 99, 111, 119, 125, 129, 138, 144, 146, 152, 157, 167, 168
# Revelation 20

1-3) the scarlet dragon
	- bound 1000yrs, then judged ~ like book of Enoch

4) The resurrection story


8-9) after 1000yrs of direct reign of Christ, Satan has no problem deceiving the nations.
BUT...fire drill


12) ?The Books are, perhaps, the revealed scriptures?
Revelation

 1:19) outline
 	what you saw
 		1:4 - 1:20
 		the son of man glorified
 		the revelation
 		the interpretation
 	what is
 		2:1 - 3:22
 		Ephesus
 		Smyrna
 		Pergamum
 		Thyatira
 		Sardis
 		Philadelphia
 		Laodicea
 	what will be
 		4:1 - 22:21
 		preceding the great tribulation
 		the great tribulation
 		the second coming and the aftermath
 		the messianic kingdom
 		the aftermath
 		the eternal order

550 references to the O.T.

the book mostly puts older prophecies into order

Biblical usage of symbols is consistent
	"hidden" meanins are always explainecd elsewhere in the bible

The giving of the revelation
	Father -> Messiah -> angel -> John -> believers

Understanding this book requires digging into much of the O.T.
# Revelation 10

These events come between the 6th and 7th trumpets.


4) John is not to concern himself with the doings, he is to concern himself with the scroll.  Like Elijah we must heed the still, small voice...the ordinary business of life.


8) the angel straddles sea & land like a link from humanity to the kingdom

9) Ez 2:8+

10) like the word it is satisfying and painful

11) the calling: consume the word, then proclaim it

# Revelation 2


7) 


25-28) Jesus uses messianic language to describe the believe apportment.
The "morning star" is a messianic symbol.
...as is shepherding, authority over nations, and conquering/dominion

[Num 24:17] ~ this postcedes the messiah, it is celestial language looking forward to the Church.

		...membership
			private name (salvation)


26) Threefold requirements:
- overcome (by faith 1Jn 5:4)
- keeps my works
- ...until the end


# Revelation 21

"pure gold, like clear glass"
...interestingly, gold takes on a bright, almost white appearance with a high silver content.
...the implication is the glory imbued with the blood in significant amounts. 

2) New Jerusalem ~= bride?  Does that mean a physical instantiation of connected believing humanity (per [1Cor 3:16])?

3) A new Tabernacle; God among the people


22) "no temple", Yahweh _is_ the temple.  As in v.2 ... the Church is transformed?

# Revelation 22


Note the contradistinctions:
- evil vs. righteous
- filthy vs. holy

2) healing of nations means...what?
# Revelation 3


12)
"write on him the name of my God" this is a common monikerby which Yahweh marks his people.
...I wonder if our spiritual dimension is marked in a way that is visible to elohim.


21) The conqueror will sit "**with me on My throne**"!
That is amazing...clearly we are not unified with Him or supplanting Him but working alongside.
Caveat: for the overcomer

# Revelation 5


1) The title deed (written on front & back) of the universe


5) He _has_ overcome ~ past tense


10) This is the end-game.
They will return on the Earth.Romans 12


"No one should have an exaggerated view of their own importance."  JB Phillips

1) Providing our bodies as living sacrifices is our rational service.
Worship is all-encompassing: physical, mental, and spiritual.
[Deut 6]

2) acceptance of the sacrifice means transformation _by God_
conformation ~ syschematizo
transformation ~ metamorphoo
renewing ~ anakainosis

The Will of God is:
  agathon ~ good
  euareston ~ pleasing
  teleion ~ purposed


13-18) The practices of the honorable:
- hospitality
- bless, not curse, their persecutors
- celebrate
- mourn
- harmony
- forgive
- peace
Romans 14


17)	kingdom of God
	NOT eating and drinking (carnal, high-church)
	= righteousness [Is 59:17] [Eph 6:14] [Zech 3:4]
	= peace [Php 4:7]
	= joy [Ps 4:7] [Heb 12:2]Romans 8


28-30) Foreknown -> Predestined -> Called -> Justified -> Glorified

28) all things work together
 the culmination of events is good
 the good worked by God is for His children;
 ~ we can, thus, surmise that does not work evil for outsiders but He leaves them to the consequences of their actions

29) foreknown
    predestined (pre what?  pre-us)
	  to be conformed
30) called
    justified
	glorified
# Romans 1

1) The issue of life is not _who_ we are, rather, _whose_ we are.
	[1Cor 7:23]
Romans 10


13) {Joel 2:32}
  Everyone is invited
  God's sovereignty = election
  God's justice = calling
    Grace is required because holiness requires justice and justice requires mercy

14) ignorance is no excuse, but it demands the mercy of proclaiming the gospel
  {Acts 1:8}
  {2Cor 5:18-21}

15) Sending
  Intentional
  Prayer
  Encouragement
  {Ps 127:4+}

  {Is 52:7}


18) "They have" heard ~ everyone has heard and is obligated to the truth [Rom 1]

Whose voice?
  [Ps 19:4] ~ the heavens' voice
    the gospel may be available in the mazzaroth (zodiac) but it is not _presented_ in the way that a King's representative can


29) foreknown
    predestined (pre what?  pre-us)
    to be conformed

30) temporal?
  predestined ~ proorizo
  called ~ kaleo
  justified ~ dikaioo
  glorified ~ doxazo
# Romans 11


25) 


26) What is "all Israel"
- ethnic Jews?
- subset of Israel?  all Jews are Israelites but not all Israelites are Jews
- [Gal 3]

Jews
- the term "Jew" was created by the captor to describe the captives
    - [Jer 34:9] ~ 
    - [Dan] 
    - [Zech 8:23] ~ 
- Israelite was the preferred self-address
- 'udios' and Jew are not synonomous

We associate "Jew" based on an ethnic group associated with the Tanakh and Biblical festival-keeping.
The Biblical authors spoke of 'udios' as an ethnic construct but w/o the religious aspect.
They also used Israel as a sociological construct based on theology: Yahweh as LORD.
Romans 13

Yahweh isn't instituting a governmental system nor condoning one.
He is simply instructing on how to live within their system.

1-4) civil governmental authority is given by God

3-4) We are not required to submit to any government but we must be cognoscent of the ramifications


8-10) there is something greater that ought to drive governance


14) "put on The Lord Jesus Christ":
Lord/Kyrion ~ kingship
Jesus ~ humanity
Christ ~ messianic
# Romans 3

10) "no one": [Ps 14:1]()
# Romans 4


1) Through the flesh Abraham gained wealth and prestige...but only because God allowed it.

2) Abraham had no cause to boast of before God.

3) Abraham's belief culminates in righteousness...by God's work. 

4) The one who works ~ earns his wage.
Does God promise us wages?
  [Rom 6:23]
  [Prov 11:18]
  [Zech 11:12] ~ the slave price 
  [Luke 10:7]
  

5) The one who doesn't work ~ if he believes, attaining faith, he is righteous.
Ungodly = the absolute worst of sinners.
..yet still redeemable by Christ.


9-10) Abraham was counted as righteous [Gen 15] before his circumcision [Gen 17:10+]
# Romans 5

3-4) suffering -> endurance -> character -> hope

5)  peace
6)  saved from God


11) consider ~ we have the new nature but must embrace it

12) This refers to _human_ death
Problem: why does Jesus get off the hook?  He is 100% human [by gospel necessity].
Adam sinned, and incurred guilt because of it, and imputed mortality to his progeny.
...our guilt for sin is not inherited
Damnation is earned by 1) people incur moral guilt and 2) they do not have that guilt removed by Christ's work.

sin entered{dia}, death spread{diylthen}


The analog of circumcision with baptism explains O.T. salvation.


15) an extension of the question in v.1


18) 

19) many **or** all?

20) sin is additive, grace is multiplicative
Romans 6


1) Is it okay to break the speed limit if you can afford the fine?  No.
The act is still wrong even if we can (or think we can) withstand the judgment.


6) God wants to kill you
...He isn't as concerned with the soon you struggle with as He is with the ones you aren't struggling with
~= freedom...life


12) 'let' sin reign (implies a voluntary allowance (or not))
_topos_ ~ a dwelling place
18) no-thing good lives in me:
  no worldly nicety meets the true standard if good


22-24) Sin makes us captive within ourselves and unable to engage in our work.


25) a slave cannot free themselves
Romans 9


4) to them belong:
adoption = [Ez 16]
glory = Shekinah
covenants = Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David
law = Torah
temple = sacred space


11) God's election pre-dates any humans' creation


13) [Mal 1:2b] God's hate is not merit-based but His own perogative.
Justice is owed to humanity, grace is not.
The great mystery is not that Esau was hated but that Jacob was loved.

Abraham asked, "will not the Lord of the Earth be just?".  Actually, no...instead He gives mercy and grace to many [2Pet 3:9]

# Ruth 1

The daughters looked to Naomi for their salvation.

The beginning of the barley harvest.

# Ruth 2

The law of gleaning - owner may make one pass to collect crops, the rest was left for the poor.

Boaz, the _Lord of the harvest_ shows grace toward Ruth personally and via his servants.

12) "Under whose wings" the grace of the believer is attributed to Yahweh.


14) Boaz serves Ruth bread & wine


19-23) Naomi recognizes Boaz's interest and coaches Ruth in that direction.


[Rev 5]


[Lev 25:47-50] Redemption
[Deut 25:8-11] Levirite marriage
# Ruth 3

Threshing ~ tossing the grain to separate the chaff and prepare it for market.

The hem (sheul, crespidon) was the sign of rank.
...cutting off a hem stripped someone of authority
...spreading the "skirt" over someone was a sign of protection, acceptance

Ruth is propositioning Boaz by submitting to him as a wife.

Boaz is flattered by Ruth's proposition.
- he defers to the law which presupposes her marriage to a nearer kinsman
- he also gives her a substantial gift: 6 measures of barley to Naomi via Ruth
	...the message is that He will not rest until the matter is resolved
	...symbolic of a gift to the Jews via the Church


The city gate is analogous to _City Hall_ - the seat of power
- Boaz was a city official 

10 men as witness (10 = the number of witness)
- Go'el = kinsman redeemer; this is the role of Boaz
- there was a problem whereby the nearer kinsman was not able to redeem the land

The Torah expressly forbade men marrying Moab women
- Boaz was the "son" of Rahab

Similitude
- Ruth had to have the volition to submit herself to marriage
- Boaz was not only the redeemer but completed the entire process _alone_ ~ the entirety of the work was His
# Ruth 4


A toast to Perez, the illegitimate son of Judah & Tamar?
During the era of the judges.

Establishes David's connection to Judah.

Establishes Jesus birthplace [Bethlehem].

# Song of Solomon 8

6) Love as strong as death:
- death is unavoidable and universal
- false love fades and is situational
Jealousy as fierce as the grave
- the grave takes wholly, suddenly, and indiscriminately
- apathy causes discrimination, partiality, and sloth
# Titus 1


Elder ~ Presbyteros
1. Elderly = of age, from _presbus_
2. Leadership office, the application of that advanced age (wisdom, experience)


I. Blameless
  1. Not just unaccussed but unguilty
  2. He must be a loyal believer.
  3. He must not be actively rebellious.

II. Husband of one wife ~ "one wife's husband"

III. Faithful children, not guilty of profligacy or rebellion
  1. He must have children.
  2. His children must not have departed the faith
    a. The implication is that they must be old enough to have established faith if there had been an opportunity to leave it.
  3. Unrebellion means:
    a. Not separated from the Church by choice.
    b. Contributing members of the Church.

14) It is not the inhabitants of the holy city but the survivors, the remnant taken from it, who enjoy salvation.
Although the ESV is in general more literal and reliable than most English versions published in recent years, it does need correction or improvement in a few places, and in some places the changes from the RSV are not for the better. Here I offer some criticism of weak renderings and other problems I have noticed here and there in the version.
In Genesis 3:6 the ESV follows the example of the NIV with “she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate,” where the RSV had “she also gave some to her husband, and he ate.” The RSV rendering is to be preferred here, because the Hebrew (lit. “she also gave some to her husband with her,” as in the KJV, ASV and NASB) does not say or imply that Adam was with Eve at the time and place of her temptation. The ordinary way of expressing “who was with her” would be אשר־עמה, not merely עמה. There is nothing corresponding to the words “who was” in the Hebrew, and the word עמה (“with her”) in 3:6 has an adverbial force, according to a common usage of the preposition (see עם in the lexicons). This sentence should be interpreted “she gave some to her husband as well, or also.” This is the interpretation of the Vulgate, RSV, Berkeley, NEB, REB, TEV and NJPS translations, and of most of the commentators. Gordon J. Wenham in his recent commentary (Genesis 1-15, in the Word Biblical Commentary series, published in 1987) ignores the NIV rendering, explains that the phrase “emphasizes the man’s association with the woman in the eating,” and points to the similar phrases in Genesis 6:18, 7:7, and 13:1. Clearly the narrative, which represents the Serpent talking only with Eve and not Adam, presupposes a situation where the serpent has caught Eve alone. It was the serpent’s clever plan to mislead the woman when she was alone, because she could be more easily led astray in the absence of her husband. He targets the more vulnerable woman first, and through her he eventually gets the man as well. The fact that later God blames Adam not for listening to the serpent but for “listening to the voice of your wife” (3:17) also indicates that Adam was not present to hear the serpent’s words; it was through Eve’s persuasion that he ate the fruit. Evidently he did not hear the serpent’s words directly. This, at any rate, is the ancient Jewish understanding of what happened, and it is also the view presupposed by the apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 2:14, where the prohibition of female leadership in the church is based on the fact that Eve (and not Adam) was deceived by the serpent. If the ESV revisers meant to convey the idea here that Adam was at the tree with Eve while she was being tempted, watching silently while the serpent tells lies to his wife, it indicates a certain lack of exegetical sobriety and conservatism; but unfortunately it does seem that this was their intention. Several people who were involved in the production of the ESV have quoted this rendering in support of the idea that the root cause of the Fall (i.e. the “original sin”) was Adam’s passivity, his failure to take charge of the situation and control his wife’s behavior at this critical moment. 3 This is a pretty serious misuse of the text, enabled by a misleading translation of one Hebrew word.
In Genesis 41:8 the ESV translators were less careful than the RSV to indicate a departure from the Masoretic text. The RSV has here “Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it,” and gives a footnote telling readers that the Hebrew actually says “there was none who could interpret them.” The ESV regularizes the grammar differently: “Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them,” but without indicating that the Hebrew says “dream,” not “dreams.”
In Genesis 41:56 the ESV footnote reads “Hebrew, all that was in them” where the RSV note said “Gk Vg Compare Syr: Heb all that was in them.” The RSV note is much more informative, and we cannot understand why the ESV revisers deleted the references to the ancient versions supporting the emendation.
In their revision of the RSV, the ESV editors tend to substitute numerals for words expressing quantities; for example, the ESV has “16,000” instead of the RSV’s “sixteen thousand” in Numbers 31:46. In this the ESV editors were merely using a convention of style used in modern books. But this usage of numerals carries with it an implication of precise enumeration which is obviously not intended by the biblical authors. For us, there is a difference between writing “1,000” and “a thousand.” It would have been better to leave the RSV’s old-fashioned “thousands” and “hundreds” alone.
In Exodus 20:19 we find that the RSV’s “but let not God speak to us” has been changed to “but do not let God speak to us,” as if the people thought that God needed Moses’ permission to speak. But this is not at all the meaning of the Hebrew jussive tense here, which expresses a command or plea, and not any idea of permission. Apparently an ESV style editor who knew neither Hebrew nor English very well thought that the RSV’s use of the English jussive form “Let not …” was just some stilted way of saying “Do not let.”
In Deuteronomy 15:4-5 the RSV punctuation is much better than the ESV’s. The ESV has obscured the meaning of the sentence with its revised punctuation, and there does not seem to be any good reason for it.
RSV: But there will be no poor among you (for the LORD will bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance to possess), if only you will obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all this commandment which I command you this day.	ESV: But there will be no poor among you; for the LORD will bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance to possess— if only you will strictly obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all this commandment that I command you today.
For the mishandling of the textual issue in Deuteronomy 32:43 see the comments above under “Text-Critical Treatment of the Old Testament.” We really must question the wisdom of eliminating a line found in the Masoretic text and the Septuagint, and also quoted in Romans 15:10. But in addition to that, here we also must wonder why they have rendered כפר kipper as “cleanses” instead of the RSV’s “makes expiation.” The word כפר is full of cultic significance, being the word used when the priest makes atonement for sins at the altar of sacrifice. The BDB Lexicon explains that when God is the subject of this verb, “It is conceived that God in his sovereignty may himself provide an atonement or covering for men and their sins which could not be provided by men” (p. 497). The Christian meaning of this phrase leaps off the page at us in the RSV and other versions. But with the ESV’s rendering “cleanses” (a sense unsupported by either BDB or Koehler-Baumgartner) it is quite hidden from us. Where did this weak rendering come from? It seems that the ESV revisers have borrowed it from the NRSV (which also contains the same text-critical emendation of the verse). The NRSV had borrowed it from a Jewish version—the New JPS version of 1982, which in a note claimed that “the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain” here. But the meaning of the Hebrew is quite clear: God himself makes atonement for his people.
The ESV rendering of 2 Kings 5:13 is peculiar. “My father, it is a great word the prophet has spoken to you; will you not do it?” The Hebrew here is better understood along the lines of the RSV’s “My father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?”
The RSV’s rendering of the words עִם־חָסִיד תִּתְחַסָּד in Psalm 18:25, “With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal,” is better than the ESV’s “With the merciful you show yourself merciful.” Probably the best rendering here would be “faithful.”
The ESV editors have added a footnote to Psalm 42:5, explaining that the Hebrew words which they have rendered “my salvation and my God” (RSV “my help and my God”) are literally “the salvation of my face and my God.” But the Masoretic text printed in the standard editions (e.g. Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) says “the salvation of hisface [i.e. his presence]. My God ....” (cf. the KJV, ASV, NASB, etc.) The RSV and ESV translators have employed an emendation here, which ought to have been mentioned in this note.
In Isaiah 31:5 the ESV leaves unrevised the RSV’s “he will spare,” a rather weak translation of the Hebrew פסח, lit. “pass over.” As R.B.Y. Scott observes, the KJV’s “passing over is better than he will spare, because it preserves the allusion to the deliverance commemorated by the Pesach (Passover) festival; the verb appears in the O.T. only here and in Exod. 12.” 4
In Isaiah 48:10 the ESV revisers have added a footnote indicating that the word translated “I have tried” (בחר) may be understood as “I have chosen,” and this is a step in the right direction. But “I have chosen” should be in the text itself. The RSV’s rendering “I have tried” is so poorly supported that it should not even be mentioned in a note. (For more on this, see the discussion in chapter 8 of my essay Against the Theory of Dynamic Equivalence.)
In Isaiah 55:1 the interjection הוי hoy at the beginning of the verse receives no proper equivalent in the ESV. The RSV, following the KJV, had interpreted it as a mere exclamation to attract attention: “Ho, every one who thirsts, come ...” But in the ESV (as in the NIV) it disappears completely: “Come, everyone who thirsts ...” Probably the ESV revisers felt that the RSV’s “Ho” was too archaic, but could not think of something more appropriate. “Oh!” would have served the purpose quite well. In Hebrew the interjection הוי is not just a meaningless shout like “hey!” — it is a cry of poignant emotion (usually translated “Alas”), and the ESV should not have stifled it. Also, the last sentence in this verse probably should have been revised along the lines of the rendering of the New JPS version: “Buy food without money, / Wine and milk without cost.” The verb שׁבר means “buy grain” or “buy food” when used intransitively, as may be seen in the immediately preceding clause (“buy food and eat”); and the conventions of parallelism in Hebrew poetry should lead us to expect separate objects for the two prepositional phrases “without money” and “without cost.”
In Jonah 3:3 the Hebrew states that Nineveh was a city “of three days’ walk” (מהלך שלשת ימים). The RSV interpreted this to mean that the city was “three days’ journey in breadth,” which implies that the biblical author thought that Nineveh was at least sixty miles across. This is obviously impossible, and the expression need not be interpreted this way. It may refer to the circumference of greater Nineveh, taking in the suburbs (this interpretation is supported by Genesis 10:11-12, in which Nineveh and its suburbs are collectively called the “great city”), or it may be interpreted as saying that it would take a man three days to walk through all of its streets, without attributing any error to the author. But the ESV revisers have not changed the RSV rendering here. They have added a footnote saying that it may mean “a visit was a three days’ journey” (a clumsy rendering borrowed from the NIV); but in the text they should have just gone back to the literal rendering of the KJV, “of three days’ journey.”
In Luke 17:21 the RSV rendering of ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστίν, “the kingdom of God is in the midst of you,” is left unchanged. This very questionable interpretation is also found in other modern versions. But ἐντὸςdoes not mean “in the midst,” it means “within” (same word translated “inside of” in Matt. 23:26), as in the KJV and NKJV. 5
In John’s Gospel the ESV (following most other modern versions) translates the word μονογενής monogenes as “only,” rather than “only-begotten.” Although most commentators of the present day have argued that “only” is an adequate translation of this word, others maintain that this is an undertranslation of an important theological term. The ESV revisers would do well to include a footnote informing readers of the traditional rendering, “only begotten.” For a full discussion of this matter see my recent article, The Only Begotten Son.
In John 3:31 the RSV’s rendering of καὶ ἐκ τῆς γῆς λαλεῖ “and of the earth he speaks” is more literal and more accurate than the ESV’s “and speaks in an earthly way.” But better than both would be “and speaks from the earth.”
We are dismayed to find that in John 8:42 the ESV revisers have changed the RSV’s “I proceeded and came forth from God” to “I came from God and I am here,” in imitation of the NIV. This fails to indicate the true sense of the words. In the Greek text we read here ἐγὼ γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐξῆλθον καὶ ἥκω, in which the combination of ἐκ andἐξῆλθον is most naturally understood as a “proceeding out from” the Father. As Alford observes, “and come [καὶ ἥκω] conveys the result of proceeded forth [ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐξῆλθον] ... mere sending will not exhaust the termproceded forth, which must be taken in its deeper theological meaning, of the proceeding forth of the Eternal Son from the essence of the Father.” 6
In the next verse, John 8:43, the ESV carries over the RSV’s “Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.” This presents the verse as if Christ were saying that the unbelieving Jews could not understand his meaning because their minds were too stubborn to receive it. That may be true, but it is not what Jesus is saying here. The verse should be translated more literally: “Why do you not understand my speech[λαλια]? It is because you cannot hear my word [λογος].” The word λογος here is not just another way of sayingλαλια; it refers to the mental concepts expressed by his figurative λαλια.
The RSV’s weak rendering “together” for ὁμοθυμαδον in Acts 2:46, 4:24, 5:12, 7:57, 19:29 and Romans 15:6 should have been changed to “with one accord” (as in the ASV and other literal versions).
In Acts 3:26 the RSV had, “God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness.” The problem here is that “every one of you” is too strong a rendering ofἕκαστον, which means nothing more than “each.” Many of those who heard Peter were blessed with such repentance, but not every one of them. The exaggerated translation was noticed by the NRSV revisers, who changed “every one of you” to “each of you.” the ESV revisers changed “in turning” to “by turning” (a mere stylistic change), but the more important problem escaped their attention.
In Romans 3:23 the ESV revisers should have at least added a footnote indicating that the word translated “fall short” may be understood as “are deprived,” in agreement with the Vulgate, Luther, Calvin, Geneva Bible, Revised English Bible, New American Bible, and several modern commentators.
The RSV’s punctuation of Romans 4:16-17 should have been changed back to that of the ASV and KJV. The dashes here should be replaced with commas, and the clause “as it is written, I have made you the father of many nations” should be put in marks of parenthesis.
In Romans 8:20-21 the ESV’s “in hope that the creation” is clumsy, and likely to be misunderstood by readers.
The ESV revisers have omitted the RSV footnote at 1 Corinthians 7:21, which indicated that Paul may be telling slaves to “make use of your present condition instead” of setting their hearts on emancipation. (See a full discussion of the interpretation of this verse here.) This interpretation not only deserves a note, it should have been put in the text.
The ESV gives the word “betrothed” as a rendering for παρθένος in 1 Cor. 7:25, 34, 36, 37, 38. But παρθένοςdoes not mean “betrothed,” it means “virgin.” The ESV rendering is an interpretation rather than a translation of the Greek.
What is meant by “baptized into Moses” in 1 Corinthians 10:2? This rendering of εἰς τὸν Μωϋσῆν ἐβαπτίσθησαν is carried over from the RSV, but it makes no sense. The ASV’s “unto Moses” was much better. It is likely that when Paul speaks of baptism εις Χριστον he has in mind the idea of incorporation, and so “into” may be best in Romans 6:3, Galatians 3:27, and 1 Corinthians 12:13. But in places where the mystical union or incorporation into the body of Christ is not in view (e.g. Matthew 28:19, 1 Corinthians 1:15 and 10:2), εις after the verb βαπτιζω should ordinarily be understood “unto” or “for,” not “into” or “in.”
In 1 Corinthians 10:11 the ESV revisers give a more accurate translation of the adverb τυπικῶς by substituting “as an example” for the RSV’s “as a warning,” but they overlooked the fact that this changes the thought in such a way that the δὲ in the following clause must be rendered “and” instead of “but.”
The ESV’s use of “wife” as a translation of γυνή in 1 Corinthians 11 is very questionable. This passage is about the status and behavior suitable to womankind, not just of wives. And there is no indication here that Paul viewed headcoverings as a symbol of the married state. But Wayne Grudem (who played a major role in the production of the ESV) has already used the ESV rendering to support his idea that “Today we obey the head covering commands for women in 1 Corinthians 11 by encouraging married women to wear whatever symbolizes being married in their own cultures ... married women today should not hide their wedding rings.” 7 The ESV rendering looks like an attempt to provide support for Grudem’s notion about the appropriate modern application in advance. (See Grudem’s discussion of the passage here, and a refutation of it here.)
In 2 Corinthians 4:16 we find another example of a weak RSV rendering which should have been improved in the ESV: “Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day.” The phrase “outer nature” does not convey the meaning of the Greek here, which says “outward man.” Paul means by this the same thing that he means when he speaks of the sin-prone “body of flesh.” So probably the best way to render it would be, “Though our outward body is wasting away, our inner man is being renewed ...” (Note: After 2007, printings of the ESV have “outer self” and “inner self.”)
There is a tendency in the ESV to substitute the singular “man” for the plural “men” in various places, and so we find the very odd expression “the children of man” instead of the familiar “children of men” or “sons of men” in some places. “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man” (υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων, Mark 3:28). Apparently the ESV editors decided that they would use the collective singular “man” inclusively, but not “men.” This editorial policy is arbitrary and artificial. People who are used to the all-inclusive use of “man” can also understand “men” when it is used in this sense. We also see that the ESV revisers often avoid translating the singular ανθρωπος as “man,” despite the fact that it means just that in Greek. This looks like a sop for those who have been demanding “inclusive language” revisions of the Bible. But there is no point in trying to please that crowd with half-measures like this.
In Galatians 1:15 “reveal his Son to me” should have been revised to “reveal his Son in me.” The preposition ενdoes not mean “to,” and as Raymond Stamm rightly points out, the RSV’s “to me ... does not express the mystical fellowship described in 2:20; cf. II Cor. 13:3.” 8 It should also be noted that Paul’s use of “in me” (εν εμοι) was likely prompted by “from the womb” in the preceding clause.
In Philippians 3:16 “hold true to” is a poor rendering for στοιχεῖν (stoichein). The rendering is sanctioned by Bauer’s Wörterbuch, but this is one of many weakened senses proposed in that lexicon with no real warrant. The word means “walk in line with others according to a rule” (see Vine, Vincent, Moule).
In Colossians 1:16 ἐν αὐτῷ, which in the RSV was “in him,” has been changed to “by him” by the ESV revisers. This is the old rendering of the KJV, which in the past has caused people to think the apostle is saying the Son was actually the Creator. To prevent that misinterpretation the ESV revisers have added a note here, “That is, by means of; or in.” But why not simply put “by means of” in the text? We also note that in the following verse the RSV’s translation of ἐν αὐτῷ as “in him” has been left unrevised. Surely the rendering of the phrase should be the same in both places.
The RSV renderings for the adjective ατακτος in 1 Thess. 5:14, the adverb ατακτως in 2 Thess 3:6 and 3:11, and the verb ατακτεω in 2 Thess. 3:7 should have been revised. In these places, the RSV renderings (“idlers,” “in idleness,” and “were idle”) were retained, despite the fact that most scholars now agree that the old renderings of the KJV and ASV (“unruly/disorderly,” “disorderly,” and “behaved disorderly”) were more accurate. See the remarks on this subject in my review of the RSV. The difference here is not merely academic. If the words do not have the specific meaning of “idle” or “lazy,” and Paul is commanding the Thessalonians to “withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us” (2 Thess. 3:6, ASV), then the command has a much broader scope. For those who are seeking Scriptural guidance in matters of church discipline, the possibilities of application are different.
In 1 Timothy 1:10 the ESV’s “enslavers” is a less accurate rendering of ανδραποδισταις than the RSV’s “kidnappers.” With this inaccurate rendering (and with the deletion of the RSV footnote at 1 Corinthians 7:21) the ESV seems to be providing ammunition for Wayne Grudem’s recent arguments against liberals who like to equate the Bible’s statements about the place of woman with its statements about slavery. In response to one recent book that makes this comparison (William Webb’s Slaves, Women, and Homosexuals), Grudem writes that the Bible “gives principles that would modify and ultimately lead to the abolition of slavery (1 Cor. 7:21-22; Gal. 3:28; Philem. 16, 21; and note the condemnation of ‘enslavers’ at 1 Tim. 1:10, ESV, a verse that was previously overlooked in this regard because it was often translated ‘kidnappers’).” 9
In Titus 1:1 the ESV renders the preposition κατα “for the sake of,” when it should be “in accordance with,” as in 2 Tim 1:1 and elsewhere. “For the sake of” is a rendering with little or no support in biblical Greek. Bauer cites only John 2:6 and 2 Cor 11:21 for this proposed meaning (enumerated as II.4 in his Wörterbuch), but in those places it is just as questionable, and with respect to Titus 1:1 he adds, “doch ist auch d. Bedeutung ‘entsprechend,’ ‘nach,’ ‘gemäß’ möglich.” (“though the meaning ‘correspond to,’ ‘according to,’ ‘suitable for’ is also possible.”) The translation “for the sake of” is employed here only because some commentators have objected to the idea that Paul would have described his apostleship as one which corresponds to or is in accordance with “the faith of God’s elect,” because this would imply that Paul’s authority receives its validity from his doctrinal agreement with “the faith” of the elect (Huther, followed by Alford and many others). But that is precisely what he is saying here! Compare Galatians 1:8. Calvin remarks, “It is as if he had said, ‘There is a mutual agreement between my apostleship and the faith of the elect of God; and therefore, it will not be rejected by any man who is not a reprobate and opposed to the true faith.’”
In Hebrews 11:1 the ESV leaves the RSV’s rendering unchanged, translating the words Εστιν δε πιστις ελπιζομενων υποστασις with “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for.” But Bauer states that the proposed sense “confidence, assurance” (Zutrauen, Zuversicht) for the word υποστασις “must be eliminated, since examples of it cannot be found,” and prefers the meaning “realization, materialization” (Verwirklichung). Helmut Köster in the TDNT (vol. 8, pp. 572-89) also rejects “assurance” is an “untenable” sense, and argues that in the Epistle to the Hebrews υποστασις is a developed theological term referring to the invisible, transcendent “reality” of God contrasted with the shadowy and insubstantial phenomena of this corruptible world. Günther Harder in the New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology (1975) also rejects the proposed sense “assurance” and favors “realization.” According to Harder, the “realization” of things hoped for means that “the thing hoped for works through faith and produces action and attitudes. Thus Abraham hoped for a future city and therefore chose the life of a sojourner” (vol. 1, p. 714). The revised BDAG lexicon of 2000 continues to warn translators that the sense given in the RSV “must be eliminated” from consideration, but, citing now the usage of the word in non-literary papyri, suggests that “guarantee of ownership/entitlement, title deed” may be the sense of υποστασις in Hebrews 11:1. This concerns no minor point of exegesis: it makes a real difference in our understanding of an often-quoted verse which appears to set forth a definition of “faith,” and discussions of it may be found in any exegetical commentary. The original fault here was that of the RSV translators, who unwisely eliminated the footnote of the ASV (“or, the giving substance to” things hoped for), but the ESV revisers should at least have restored the ASV’s footnote here, or in some other way indicated that many (perhaps most) scholars who have carefully considered the matter have preferred other interpretations.
In 2 Peter 1:1 and Titus 2:13 the ESV revisers have eliminated the RSV footnotes. But the marginal renderings “our God and the Saviour Jesus Christ” and “the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” (which appear in the text of the KJV and ASV) should continue to be acknowledged as viable alternatives to the renderings adopted in the ESV text. See further comments on these verses in my review of the NET Bible.
I might add many other things to this collection of criticisms. Some of the faults are quite annoying. But mostly they are the kind of minor faults that may be observed in any version.

Thus speaketh Christ our Lord to us,
“You call Me master and obey Me not,
	You call Me light and see Me not,
	You call Me way and walk Me not,
	You call Me life and choose Me not,
	You call Me wise and follow Me not,
	You call Me fair and love Me not,
	You call Me rich and ask Me not,
	You call Me eternal and seek Me not,
	You call Me noble and serve Me not,
	You call Me gracious and trust Me not,
	You call Me might and honor Me not,
	You call Me just and fear Me not,
	If I condemn you…blame me not.”

could mamzer in terms of Orpah's children, in counterpoint to David's descent from Ruth, refer to a spiritual father rather than a genetic one?   [Deut 23:2-3].  Or could it be the father's line matters more?

Angels

Archangel - Michael
	one of the chief princes

Jewish tradition
	Michael
	Gabriel
	Uriel
	Raphiel
	Raggiel
	Sarriel
	Remmiel (Jeremiel, Ez 4:36)


Generally the term _angelos_ is used to denote these beings who inhabit the spiritual realm and are loyal to Yahweh.  The hebrew word for angel is _mal'akh_.

Interestingly: both _theos_ and _elohim_ are used to describe these same, created beings.
This term denotes a king rather than a role.
i.e. God inhabits the spiritual realm and is, thus, elohim; He is also **the** Elohim in that He is superior to the others.

A poem inscribed inside the Lübeck Cathedral in Germany.

“Thus speaketh Christ our Lord to us:
Ye call Me Master and obey Me not.
Ye call Me Light and see Me not.
Ye call Me Way and walk Me not.
Ye call Me Life and choose Me not.
Ye call Me Wise and follow Me not.
Ye call Me Fair and love Me not.
Ye call Me Rich and ask Me not.
Ye call Me Eternal and seek Me not.
Ye call Me Noble and serve Me not.
Ye call Me Gracious and trust Me not.
Ye call Me Might and honor Me not.
Ye call Me Just and fear Me not.
If I condemn you, blame Me not.”

	[Chronology] is emperical.  We exist in an ever progressing series of events.  The fact of this in conjunction with the notion that other modes of existence are possible allows us to begin thinking about God.

Green - growth and life
  [Gen 1:30]() ~ the color of the plant helps us identify which ones are good for food
  [Mark 6:39]() ~ the color helps identify the season
  [Luke 23:31]() ~ the color interviews the quality of the product
  [Rev 8:7, 9:3]() ~ green plants are those that are palatable and in-season


Red - blood and war

God is always the one doing the dividing.
His divisions are personal or end-of-times.

[Acts 22:41]

God's current acts are about adding to and multiplying His church.


[John 10:10]
The enemy is about dividing now.


Unity does not mean that we have to think or act the same...but that we have the same purposes.

How to Pray


This guide is based on George Mullers advice of 'How to Ascertain the Will of God' in his journal entitled: "Answers to Prayer."

Answers to prayer will come in the form a decision that we must make

Verbally disavow your own will
	it is fallen and decayed
	this is the most difficult step for most of us

Never make a rash decision
	emotional decisions are very rarely right
	decisions base on simple impressions are less rarely right

Always seek Him in the Word
	God gave us the tangible revelation for a reason: to help us seek Him

The Providence Factor
	consider circumstances and the advice of spirit-filled believers
	prayerfully attend with other dear believers

Ask for a revelation
	always be ready to take notes when you approach the throne!
	ask multiple times and evaluate the response
		responses come from the Word and, sometimes, from the Spirit within

Make the decision
	one of God's greatest gifts is volition: the ability to make decisions
	this explains why the outcome is not important, He evaluates the decision - not the result (which is foreknown by Him)
"Nothing vast renters the realm of mortals without a curse."  Sophocles

This is not true.
However it reveals a greater truth: that nothing beyond our perception can be known if not for a revelation.
This is the basis of scripture and magic.

Magic


TOREAD: Clinton Arnold


In this day and age we tend to think of magic as a mysterious, arcane art of the ancients that is long dead.
We tend to think that they were less evolved than us and their belief in magic was simply a misunderstanding of scientific fundamentals.
Robert Sawyer even goes so far as to say that all those who tend to ascribe spiritual/supernatural significance to happenings have an inferior brain structure (loosely coupled lobes).

All of this thinking is absurd.
Reality is, in fact, stranger than even ancient people imagined - and provably so via quantum mechanics.

Furthermore we (all we's in fact) tend to perform some version of sympathetic magic.
The Christian who believes that God's work depends on their prayer or work is attempting to perform sympathetic magic.
The minister who teaches anything of this sort is apostate and grievously unbiblical.
The materialist who is dogmatic in their belief of the effects of their causes is also performing sympathetic magic.
The minister who teachs this esoteric art is certainly the more honest of the two and betrays a preternatural faith.

The Christian perspective of magic typically falls into two camps:
- the eye-rollers
- the haters

...both are dangerous.
We shan't deny the supernatural nature of existence.
We must also come to embrace the absolute sovereignty and final decreetive will of Yahweh.
Any less and [I fear] the best we can hope for is a bland life's work contributing nothing stark to an anesthitized world.
Amy more and we risk being sucked into the debilitating realm of "my will".

Importantly, though we cannot deny the power of self fulfilling prophecy, Providence, and miracle.

Pattern
 = something that illustrates a doctrine.


A pattern may be a tangible item or it may be an atomic, ammoral idea.

An example:
	[Bread] is a common thing from all time.  Jesus used bread as a metaphor for Hisself as the revealed λογος.  This has many implications about the ubiquity of His truth and His provision for us.

	[Chronology] is emperical.  We exist in an ever progressing series of events.  The fact of this in conjunction with the notion that other modes of existence are possible allows us to begin thinking about God.

Some aspects of patterns used in this context:
	- ammoral (neither good nor bad)
	- ethical (has some bearing on doctrine)
	- lesson (exposits truth through simile, metaphor, or allegory linguistically or physically)


Obfuscation
	One unfortunate side-effect of modern translation techniques, which attempt to impart cultural equivalence, is that subtleties are hidden and patterns get munged.
	It would nice if there were varying grades of translations which would graduate a reader into a more literal reading when have a deeper understanding of the original philological context.

Septuagint


The Septuagint is quoted in the NT about 400 times

There are interesting differences between the septuagint and the masoretic

Does this make the septuagint canonical? or just the quoted verses?Singing


{Zeph 3:17} God sings
	Jesus sang w/ disciples
	{Heb 2:12}

Singing vastly trumps instrumental music in Scriptural occurrance

Music is always connected w/ singing (a.k.a prophesying)
	{2Chr 15}
	{2Chr 25}

Singing is what God desires to hear
	music enhances this

Traditions are wrong.  They should be approached with constructive criticism.  They generally contain truths but not Truth.  Of paramount importance is that they should never be elevated alongside Scripture.

Wife

"It seems to be a common trait of Godly men that, in common company, they never speak ill of their wives.  So it is with the Master and His bride.  What a dear price He laid down for her.  How limitless is His adoration for her if He should esteem her so."

# Behemoth

Behemoth is a classic chaos figure.
It may also reference some huge beast.

[Job 40:15]()

A group of blind men heard that a strange animal had been brought to the town but none of them were aware of its shape and form.
 Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable".
 So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it.
 The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, "This being is like a thick snake".
 For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan.
 As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk.
 The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, "is a wall".
 Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope.
 The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.

# Body Position

Here we are exploring the significance of body positioning in Bibilical text.
We'll look into variant forms, distinguish between states and actions, and dig for some meanings.


[Deut 6:7]
This passage is directing us on when to teach our children.
The gist is: all the time.
The way the Holy Spirit encapsulates life activity is by relating it to four actions: sitting, walking, lying, and rising.


## Sit

[Gen 27:19] "sit up and eat"
Can't/shouldn't eat lying down
Note also that he is commanding his fatehr

[Ex 18:14] "why do you sit alone?"
He alone, surrounded by people.
Sitting implies a retraction, almost a depressive act [submission?] as if physically succumbing to societal pressure (rather than wavering in his ethic).

[Num 32:6] "while you sit here"
Evil laziness: they sit while another goes to fight and die for them.

[Judg 4:5] "sit under the palm of Deborah"
Location does matter: she used the historical significance to give a message.

[Ruth 4:1-2] "sit down here"
Boaz is issuing a command to fellow rulera: an authoritative gesture.
This is also preparation for a legal proceeding - part of the scheme.

[Ps 1:1] "the seat of scoffers"
Interesting that sitting (ease) is the position of the scoffer.
The complainer is the idle one.

[Rev 3:21] "sit with me"
Sitting is our ultimate destination (and goal).


## Stand

[Ps 1:1] "the way of sinners"
Standing in sin is open defiance against the Creator.
Because it is active in the sense of not bneing a restful state;
But nothing is being accomplished - it is taking up space to prevent something else from occurring.
POF: believers do the same thing in opposition to the world - we fill a space that would otherwise be filled by evil or,worse, void.


## Walk

[Ps 1:1] "the counsel of the wicked"
It is quite a different matter to hear a thing than to do it.
Walking first requires standing, then a direction (hopefully a destination but not always.)
The danger of many occultic practices is that they can be done in the heart, requiring nearly no effort.


## Run

Prostrate

Bow

Kneel

Lift

Stretch

	the doorkeeper required a testimony

# Toward the East

Adam & Eve banished to the east

Cain wanders to the East

Assyrians & Babylonians are from the East

Babylonian exile is to the East

====

Jonah & Jesus were the opposite: eastward was beneficial to the hearer
# Egypt


Egypt is a real place...and is one of the oldest continuous civilizations in the world.

Egypt is, in the Bible, symbolic of the world.
- The people of God are seen retreating to Egypt for false security and God has to forcibly bring them out of it.


What kind of transformation did the Exodus reap in Egypt?
- There was great plunder, most "money" stuffs were taken ~ but the Egyptians had their [Josephian] infrastructure and fertile agricultural lands.

The proverbial progression:
  Simple -> Wayward -> Scoffer

# Favor

God instills favor to illicit His purposes
- Joseph
- Daniel
- Paul

...these were all imprisoned

[Matt 6:33]()
- favor is the addition of blessings to or life
- ...which is the result of seeking the kingdom of God

[Rom 8:28]()
- for whom? the children

[Josh 24:15]()
- favor is a choice

Favor does not mean earthly blessings, it means advancement of the kingdom of God

What do we do when we find favor?

Garment


the garment is indicative of our spiritual belief system

Jesus symbolically removed His outer garments ~ [John 13:1-15]

# Humility

Covering yourself in the mercy of another.
Images

# Lamps

The eyes both emit and receive light, physically.
I posit that the light of the lamp is the physical manifestation of our true nature.
i.e. it's energy is seen in the "eyes" just like a flame is seen atop a candle ~ they are both at this point of high energy

The following discourse outlines the imbuing and conduction of "light" to the world ~ through the Church-members:
  [Matt 5:15]() ~ You are the light of the world
  ...teach the commandments
  ...cut off sinful nature
  ...understanding depravity
  ...true service
  ...humble/private giving [contrasted]
  [Matthew 6:22]() ~ The eye is the lamp of the body.


Input:
* circumstantial
  * Proverbs 29:13 | The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.
  * Psalm 13:3 | Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
  * Psalm 38:10 | My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes—it also has gone from me.
* visible
  * Job 41:18 | His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
  * Ecclesiastes 11:7 | Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.
  * Acts 26:13 | At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me.

Output:
* Proverbs 15:30 | The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.
* Matthew 6:22 | “The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,
* Proverbs 15:30 | The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.
* Luke 11:34 | Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.

# Light 

Light is pure and...illuminating... ;p

Blamelessness, goodness, and righteousness are akin to "light"

It is most obviously this aspect of light that pertains to God.
However, there seems to also be a physical aspect of brilliant light to God
- He shines
- He blinds


As believers:
- you "are" light
- you "have" light
- you are "of" light

light "of" the eyes
light "in" the Lord
light is _sweet_

Yahweh is
- "as" light
- "gives" light

evil is akin to misconstruing light for darknes, v.v.

The physical mountains were the abode of the Gods.

  [Matt 16:18] Jesus was standing at that place when he made this declaration

Rhetorical mountains are kingdom authorities.
[Matt 17:20] this phrasing deliberately engages the Gates of Hell, the Mount of Transfiguration, and the local authorities (they would've been overlooking Herod's Temple in Ceasarea Phillipi) as _mountains_.
Mythopoeia
## a narrative genre where an artificial mythology is created to serve the story
 

C.S. Lewis:
"The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact.
The old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth, comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history.
It happens—at a particular date, in a particular place, followed by definable historical consequences.
We pass from a Balder or an Osiris, dying nobody knows when or where, to a historical Person crucified (it is all in order) under Pontius Pilate.
By becoming fact it does not cease to be myth: that is the miracle.
...
God is more than god, not less: Christ is more than Balder, not less.
We must not be ashamed of the mythical radiance resting on our theology.
We must not be nervous about "parallels" and "pagan Christs": they ought to be there—it would be a stumbling block if they weren't.
We must not, in false spirituality, withhold our imaginative welcome.
If God chooses to be mythopoeic—and is not the sky itself a myth—shall we refuse to be mythopathic?"

# Rewards

It is common refrain in the modern church that we some believers are given _extra_ rewards because of good works.
This is a flawed, divisive interpretation that depends on a set of non-biblical presuppositions.
The goal of this article is to expose how our presuppositions constrain us to a faulty interpretation.


[Mark 10:29-30]()
  There is no indication in this passage that Jesus is speaking of demarcations within the Church (i.e. the demographic of all loyal believers.)
  Jesus points are:
  1. Loyal believers are destined for improved circumstances (i.e. new earth, i.e. God's presence)
  2. There will be a reversal of how things are.
  
  If you assume that Jesus is only referencing believers then you induce a division among them.
  However, there is no reason to presume that narrowing of scope: Jesus' _many_ may well refer to humans in general.
  In this case, then, of course many who suffer now will sit with Jesus while many powerful will suffer.

[2Cor 5:10]()
  This is similar to the prior passage: the interpretation hinges on who "we...all" refers to.
  If it refers only to the Church then we induce a further division beyond salvation.
  Otherwise, we can accept the saved/not-saved grouping that God has already established.

[1Cor 3:8]()
  This passage speaks of rewards in the same vein as [Matt 6:20]().
  The thrust here is what "treasures" we can take with us.
  It clearly says that some treasures _remain_ of the day of fire (while some are disintegrated.)
  From prior verses it could easily be said that this _remaining work_ upon resurrection is family members that we had a hand in adopting.

[Rev 2:23]()
  "I will give to each on of you according to your deeds."
  First, there is no deed of ours that can influence or salvation; therefore, this passage is not speaking of salvation.
  Jesus says that the _reward_ for Jezebel [and her children] is deadly disease.
  So, the promise of a gift for the believer can be said to be life.

[Rev 22:12]()
  Jesus is bringing a reward with Him to repay humans' deeds.
  Again, if we presume that His coming is only to the Church then we induce a division.
  However, we know that Jesus is coming _to Earth_, thus, to those who live on Earth; i.e. **humans**.
  This is a summation of the gospel: believer/non-believer; as opposed to the previous interpretation which is a special coming to others.


The common flaw adjacent to this issue is presumption.
In order to glean an interpretation of post-resurrection divisions we must presume a caste system.
It is clearly possible to interpret these passages without that division.
Furthermore, inducing those divisions is detrimental to our kingdom work.
It is also antithetical to the greater biblical narrative of God expanding His family to say that there will be further divisions imposed.

This line of thought also presumes that there are different levels of closeness to God.
We know this is true on earth...but there is no reason to assume that it will be so after the resurrection.


It's illuminating to examine the rewards outline by Christ in Rev 2-3:

| locale | deed | reward |
| Ephesus | endurance | eats from the tree of life |
| Smyrna | faithfulness | no 2nd death |
| Pergamum | repentance | hidden manna, white stone |
| Thyatira | reject false-teachers | authority, morning star |
| Sardis | strengthening | dressed in white, name in the book of life |
| Philadelphia | kept the word | made a pillar |
| Laodicea | zealotry | sit with Abba |

There are no levels of believers illucidated in this passage.
The only division is believer/non-believer.

# Vocation
~ a Latinized version of "calling", _vocatzio_
...the life that God has assigned to a Christian
...and to which they are called

"You have been saved, now you are free to be."  Jim Nestigan

The real ministry of vocation is in melding our beliefs with our purpose.
Not all believers are scholars but all are theologians and this permeates all of our endeavors.

[1Cor 7:17]
assigned ~ _emerisen_ = bestowed, a distribution
called ~ _keklyken_ = an announcement

[Eph 5]

[1Cor 10:31]


## Coitus

The preimmenent example of vocation:
	Within the institution of marriage Yahweh uses the act of sexual intercourse to create.
	When the act is aligned with the vocation of husband/wife/parent it is a good work; apart from the vocation it is a selfish, sinish act.

This Bibilical pattern applies to all roles and callings.

Disallowed vocations?  e.g. prostitution: this vocation is despicable; don't forget, though, that there is prostitute in the lineage of Jesus.


## Altars

[Rom 12:1]

Just as a person can have multiple vocations there are outlet for each:
- Office
- Mine
- Marriage bed
- Kitchen
- et cetera


## Service

The goal of Biblical vocation is service and love rather than self-interest.
Thus, we have an economic establishment: an interactive, self-supporting, rules-based culture.

...what is the textual basis for this?  is the implication that Yahweh's bring up Enoch was a message to the divine council?
...does this imply that Gen 6 was coincident with Enoch? or all the aboriginal men?

God our Paragon

This lesson will focus on God as our paragon.  That is, He is an example for us.  Not only were we saved (according to the scriptures 1Cor 15:1-4), we were made friends of God (John 15) and made one with Him (John 17).

-- This can be expounded to the children by referencing how we tend to change to become like the people we spend time with:
"For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you."
John 13:15

-- it is an intentional effort to become like Him.  We can learn about Him but He really wants us to indwell His character traits throughtout our lives:
"Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.
Ephesians 5:1

-- it is difficult to transmit small behaviors.  Jesus had little time on earth and, therefore, made major accomplishments to be our example (ask kiddos what things Jesus did, look them up):
And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."
Ephesians 5:2

By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
1 John 3:16

-- this transformation is planned in advance.  He has transformed our soul [if we have trusted in Him], is transforming our mind/heart, and will transform our bodies:
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
2 Corinthians 5:17

Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
Romans 12:2

"But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself."
Philippians 3:20-21

-- ultimately God calls us join in a higher calling of spreading His Word, thus laying down our lives.  This is the mature attitude that comes later after we've become a disciple and been indoctrinally tested:
"Though he slay me, I will hope in him;  yet I will argue my ways to his face."
Job 13:15

-- God will do what God will do.  He has promised to help us in our growth:
"seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
Matthew 6:33

	It was I who knew you in the wilderness,
		in the land of drought;
*	but when they had grazed, they became full,
		they were filled, and their heart was lifted up;
		therefore they forgot me.
	So I am to them like a lion;
		like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.
	I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs;
		I will tear open their breast,
	and there I will devour them like a lion,
		as a wild beast would rip them open."

For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king, “The hand of our God is for good on all who seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him.” So we fasted and implored our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty."

	Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”

And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved."
# Charity


What you know of mercy and grace come from God.
There is nothing in natural laws and processes from which to derive charity and selflessness.
It is a fundamental tenet of existence that there must be a preternatural influx of good to counter entropic evil.
# Ecclisia Ergasia
~ church work


## Inclusion

It is a curious phenomenon, perhaps modern (perhaps not), to not be included in the work of the Church.
Identifying this phenomenon is as simple as identifying those who attend Church functions but do not participate in their planning or execution.
We have no frame of reference for this in the rest of our life:
  In a business there is rarely an individual who contributes nothing;
  Such people are typically found to be [soon] unemployed.
It is more uncommon, though not strange, for a company to be of such quality that many desire to work for it.
The many who fail to be given positions there will settle for a "lesser" position elsewhere.
This more akin to what we perceive in most congregations.

There is a core group that does most of the work and a smaller subset who actually control the organization.
The divergence [from the business example] is that congregations are happy (for the most part) to accomodate those who will attend but not contribute.
The conundrum is that (unlike in a business) there is [usually] no obvious path to gain inclusion into the working or leading caste of the Church.


## Earthen Vessels

It is not the intention, herein, to belabor a business analogy but, rather, to conflate it- because it is not an analogy.
A business is a human community, so is a Church congregation.
To deny their identity as such is to deny that there are fundamental truths under-rowing all human institutions.
That said, it is important to acknowledge the sacred quality we feel about, and legally impose upon, Church institutions.
This sacredness is not an inherent quality of an institution but is derived from the sacredness of it's members.
Similarly, a secular community is such because it's members deem it so- willingly or not.

Thus, we have businesses which are sacred and congregations which are secular.
Because a believer is sacred ground and a non-believer is not.
However, the sacrity of a community has no bearing on it's size, wealth, or effectiveness.
These things are bourne of the quality of leadership.
And the same quality that makes a strong business will make a strong congregation.

We seem to understand this metaphysically yet deny its importance.
We choose to interpret Biblical texts about leadership as descriptive texts of human happenstance [of the past].
In fact, they are prescriptive texts which ought to shape our communitys' development.
We eschew leadership and management wisdom in the forms of protocols, processes, and organization because we deem the "secular".
The truth is that these things are no more secular than money: it is the usage, and by whom, that determines that.
We anathematize leaders and managers who implement processes, create protocols, and organize deliberately because we deem it "business-like".
As above, "business-like" is a non sequitur of secularity; success is what is really in mind with statements to that end.

There is a false conflation of success (financial, attendance, etc.) with "wordly" practices.
This is not to say that we don't recognize the sacred quality of some successful congregations.
We do, however, gloss-over their aspiritual "business" practices or dismiss it as luck or some innate ability.
Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth.


## Leadership

Leadership is the ultimate answer to the woes of the modern Church.
Poor leadership is the reason we have 10,000 denominations, stagnant congregations, and daily failed ones.

Just as we are not stuck with the skills we had a birth; we are not stuck with the leadership we attained naturally (we are speaking of corporate and individual).
Orthogonally, none of us have the _talent_ of leadership- it doesn't exist and such a thing is nonsense.
Certain aspects of leadership such as charisma, engaging speech, body-language, bearing, wisdom, and discernment may develop organically in one's upbringing but these are all skills.
Skills can be developed.

Leadership is an emergent phenomena of every human community.
Communities form expectations and requirements of their leaders and fit people into those roles.
If a community is stale or unethical it is the fault of the community.
If a community is vibrant and effective it is the fault of the community.
It is the leader who perceives this and traffics in these ideals- for good or ill.

Poor leadership springs from an errant community.
We hear phrases like "just going along" or "stuck" in conjunction with poor leadership.
In reality, these communities are in a downward spiral of uneducation and opportunism.

Good leadership springs from a functioning community.
There is a tangible glow in communities that are healthy and effective.
Confusingly, Church communities also receive joy and hope from God- which we often mis-represent as healthfulness and effectiveness.
Even more confusingly, congregants who are spiritually mature can thrive in, and prop up, otherwise failing communities.
This is, in fact, the state of the world at-large: the Holy Spirit inhabiting believers creates a catholic, moral pressure.
We must not confuse this influx of energy with succes, though.


## Discipleship

What we deeply desire is the upward spiral: an ever improving community of believers.
The way we get there is, in the abstract, the same way any community achieves: training.
Community members must know what their role is and what is expected of them.

It goes without saying that leaders must have expectations of members in order to communicate them.
They must also have a channel for communicating and the skill to use it.
Failure to do so means expectations are not known, not set, or there is a blockage preventing the dissemenation of that information.

The same can said of roles: members (including leaders) must know their talents, skills, and identity.
The fundamentals of being human, with certain God-given traits and gifts, and certain acquired abilities must be continually sought- knowing them is a process.

Therein lies the rub, there is no particular skeleton or framework of success.
There are only seeds of success that grow into healthy organisms.
Learning and growing can never be about making the most of who we are, it must be about becoming.
If not then we are lost in the mental realm that Jesus died to rescue us from: that of trying to perfect a fallen nature and earn merit.
That is to say: trying to patch up a shattered tree or sew it's roots back together.
The appropriate approach to discipleship must begin with the end in mind.
We must plan for success.
We must strive to thrive.

These cliches are pervasive and prevalent because they are true.
These cliches are derided in the Church because they expose our greatest shortcoming: failure to make disciples.
The intent of a community is clearly evident in it's outcomes.
The intent of most congregations is to wait out the storm.
Thus, they tumble along the path of time singing, listening, and paying the light bill.

Bending someone in the direction they should go is the mandate of a leader.
God provides the growth, but He does it through means that we can obtain: nourishment, exercise, and rest.

Nourishment is the Bread of Life- scripture.
It begins with reading and ends with the ability to feed to others (at any level.)
In between we learn to divine Biblical concepts, study history and languages, and write meaningful content.

Exercise is wrestling with things we do not understand.
It begins the black & white and ends with the compromise of our beliefs with His.
In between we begin to grasp which things are negotiable and which are not- and why.

Rest is rumination, inspection, and introspection.
It begins with simple reflection and ends with intercession.
In between we experience restorative sleep and meditation.


## Conclusion

We have not because we ask not.
We receive not because our white-wash is impermeable.
There is a God who gave everything possible to restore a relationship with rebellious humans.
We have rejected His offer.
Even though some eventually accept it we occassionally toss it aside to wade in the shallows.
Then we clamor back crying to Him about the leaches, bruises, and scrapes.

It is time to stop entertaining notions of "better" and start codifying what it is God wants.
This is how we make His ideals our ideals.
We have millenia of human experience and divine revelation.
We reject the first as worldly in lieu of the second, not realizing that they are the same.
The work of the Church is before us yet we reject it because we reject the nature of human community for fear of it being something antithetical to God's plan.
All the while God moves elsewhere and we wonder why.
# Genealogies

[1Chr 6:3+]()
  vs.
[Ezra 7:1+]()

These are interesting because both go from Levi to Seraiah
...but Ezra leaves out some generations

This is not a proof of gaps within genealogies.
Jesus' genealogies appear to have a consistency of ~50yr per generation which gives 1250yr which is roughly congruent with the time-span from the conquest to the incarnation.
However, the gaps in Ezra's genealogy does allow us the freedom to reconcile more ancient dates.
- e.g. Babel ~ the manpower required to build the tower was more than could have been bred within 3 generations
- e.g. Egyptian captivity ~ the size of the Hebrew nation was far more than 400yr worth of generations; this, coupled with consistent Biblical numerology of 4/40/400, allows us interpretive freedom in fitting this time-period to archaelogical fact

God's amazing blessings through His well-designed plan for His wondrous purpose.

Blessings
- spiritual
- chosen before creation
- holiness
- blamelessness
- adoption

Purpose
- Purpose of will
- praise of grace
- Beloved ~= unity
- "fullness"/end of time

Method

- wisdom yielding insight
	- providence

[Eph 1:5]		he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will

[John 17:21]	that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me

[Ruth 1:17]		Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.

[Ps 135:14]		For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.

[Hose 1:10b]	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered.  And in the place where it was said to them, “You are not my people,” it shall be said to them, “Children[fn] of the living God.”

Discussions


Paul's tirade against Christianity seems like a natural end of legalism.  Nebuchadnezzar's madness is the other.

There are two problems with the judaizer's assault on Paul:
	1. He was vastly more intellectually capable than they
	2. He had the truth on his side (it is not our job to defend the Spirit)

What is the sign of belief?
	Salvation <- Faith -> Fruit
	[Gal 6] - the fruit
	[Heb 13:7] - the right to inspect fruit

What is the relationship between the Law and the Trinity?
The condescension is inherent in the makeup of the Trinity.
What did it mean that Jesus fulfilled the Law?

Shall we live how we want?
If not, shall we then forcibly do good?
If so, are we no longer free?

We can eat bacon, but why would we?
We don't use prayer sharks, but why shouldn't we?

Grace wasn't invented in the New Testament.

Is legalism a way of dealing with conviction?
Is antinomianism (via laissez faire indulgence)?


# Anger Management

# Antispiration


The apostles never called Jesus by His first name [in the scriptures].
But the angels did [Acts 1] and He declares His own name [Rev 22].

Beatitudes


Who is Jesus speaking these things to?


Does He really expect us to follow these commandments?


Can we follow these commandments?

What is the role of demons in the gospels?


Is demon-possession, in the Bible, just a euphamism for psychiatric illnesses?  Why or why not?

# Analyzing

Analysis is really where you make a work your own.
Copying another's work through re-wording or paraphrase is not analysis,
it is to produce a new work that incorporates the original ideas in some useful manner.
Extracting meaning from a passage consists of understanding four major aspects of the text.

Historical
Literary
Lexical
Theological

## Historical

When was it written?
Who wrote it?
WHo was the immediate audience?

## Literary

What is the writing style of the passage?
- Poetic
- Narrative
- Legal
- etc.

## Lexical

What are some important words in the passage?
How are those words used elsewhere in scripture?
- what is the first mention?
- what are the various translations of the word? why?

## Theological

What is the lesson given by the passage?
What is the placement of this lesson in an overall theme of scripture?
How many similar passages are there? what is their scope?
# How to Study Your Bible

[Acts 17:11]
[1Jon 2:27]
[Matt 6:6]
[Prov 1:5-7]


Ostensibly, though we are focusing on the Bible, this study method applies broadly.
Studying is: reading, thinking, and writing about a subject.
This study method strives to be:
- easy to remember
- easy to implement
- easy to pick up where you left off

Some things that will help you study well are:
- Telling others what you are studying so you can be accountable and muse with them.
- Setting aside a specific, consistent time to study (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Have a goal for your entire study.
- Have a goal for each study session.
  - If you meet this goal and want to continue, go ahead.
  - Don't stop until you've met this goal, if the goal is too lofty then change it **next time**
  - If you are part of a class then you have an assigned goal...add your own to it.

Phases of studying:
- Reading
- Thinking
- Writing
- Analyzing

**Cycle through these four phases**


## Reading

Four types of reading:
- Skimming
- Intaking
- Digesting
- Extrapolation

# The Process

Read yourself full
Talk/Think yourself empty
Write yourself clear
  Alistair Begg

This quip is not original, but it is a summation of the act of studying that will help us in our learning.

When we do these 3 things we will incorporate all the pieces we talked about in the overview.
We start small and easy and work into the more difficult, in-depth things.
We start with a study goal: are studying for a test? looking to connect with people? trying to accomplish something?
We will flow through this process multiple times as our reading and writing get more in-depth.
Throughout the flow of reading, then writing, repeating, we will revisit our goal.
If we have met our goal then we are done.
If we later decide to come back to this study then we can re-read ourselves and start right back.


## Begin

Answer these questions:

  What am I studying? ___
  
  Why am I studying it? ___


## Phase 1

Skim the material.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write a narrative about what the material: as if telling someone else it's story.

Take a break from it (could be an hour, a day, or more.)


## Phase 2

Intake the material, try to pickup the details you skimmed over before.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write a one-sentence explanation of the passage.
Then, write less than a full page of words or pictures to flesh out your explanation.

Take a break from it (could be an hour, a day, or more.)


## Phase 3

Digest the material, to understand the meaning of every word and glean every idea.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write an analysis of the material.
This is where we start to pull at the different threads of the material's tapestry:
- Who was it written to?
- Why was it written?
- How was it originally formed?
- What impact has it had? are there other interesting analyses of it?

Take a break from it (could be an hour, a day, or more.)


## Phase 4

Analyze the material, gain an understanding of ancillary works that the influenced the original.

Remember your AID thinking: 
  what associations are there? 
  what have I induced in the material? 
  what have I deduced from the material?

Write teaching materials about this work.
- Give an overview of what you are studying.
- Point out the important and/or difficult pieces of the material
- Give some guidance on what concepts are there to be studied in depth.
- Push toward other works or ideas that will magnify their understanding of this work.



  If you come up with a complete way to do this on your own then that will probably be the best- as long as it covers all the aspects.
  A good, general way to do this is:
  * Write a thesis
    - one sentence that introduces the entirety of the topic
    - If you cannot present the topic in one simple sentence then you need to continue wrestling with it until you can
  * Write an outline or a couple paragraphs introducing all the elements of the topic
  * Write out the details
    - Best to put in all the nitty-gritty after introducing the various pieces
    - A potentially helpful remembrall is, "tell them what your going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them."
  * Re-write until you get it
    - If you cannot explain it simply [the thesis] then you don't really grasp the concept
    - If you cannot give details then you don't fully understand it
    - It can always be better, but at some point it's not bad
    - It may help to imagine that you begin by explaining to someone very simple, then progress to discussing to someone wiser and wiser
# Reading

There are four types of reading:
- Skimming
- Intaking
- Digesting
- Extrapolation

These need to be done in order.
However, if your outcome does not demand it, you may skip later steps.
e.g. if you are studying familiar material
e.g. you are not interested in the subject (you are compelled to study it)
Remember this: not all writings are worth all these levels of inquiry.
i.e. this is why the Bible is a great place to learn to study: because it is worth all efforts put against it.

## Skimming

Skimming is like drifting through a book or article.
You are just letting your eyes and mind pick out high level concepts.
Do not let yourself pore over a passage.
Do not let yourself linger on words or phrases (even if they're interesting.)

## Intaking

Intaking material means reading every word.
When this is done after skimming you already have the general idea and your mind can start to fill in the gaps.

## Digesting

Digesting is a more thorough reading.
This is where you will start using a dictionary and other resource materials.
Digesting means pulling apart a work into it's component pieces.

## Extrapolation

Application of a work means you let it change your mind.
Now you will start pulling in related works to supplement your understanding.
i.e. read through the footnotes and gloss
i.e. if another work is cited, go read that work
# Thinking

For our purposes there are three types of critical thinking:
- Associative
- Inductive
- Deductive

We will be cognizant of all of these tracks for our trains of thought throughout all phases of study.
You may be the type who talks or moves or doodles while thinking: do these things on purpose to give yourself a framework to think within.


## Association

We cannot help but make associations.
This is how the human mind and brain works with reality.
The foundation of thought and memory is to learn to associate certain ideas with others.

* Make note of ideas, people, places, and things that stand out to you
* Write down these trails of association so you can follow them back to the topic at hand


## Induction

Induction is where you start making a subject your own.
You put into it your experience and intellect to understand it.
You can think of this type of understanding as using a work within yourself.
Your life is the context in which you take in and process the ideas at play.
This may not be the intended meaning but it is a valid outcome of what the author gave you.




## Deduction

Deduction is where you begin to understand a work for what it is.
You are extracting the intended meaning and ideas from the work.
At this stage you are understanding the work in it's own context apart from yourself.
# Writing

There are three styles of writing you will need to employ when studying:
- Narrative
- Explanatory
- Teaching


## Narration

Narration is, in essence, story-telling.
Your narrative needs to tell the big concepts and main points of a work.


## Explanatory

Explaining a work is essential to real understanding.
If you cannot explain is simply, you do not truly understand it
You should strive to sum up a work in a single sentence;
and then, explain it in no more than one page of notes, diagrams, etc.


## Teaching

A teaching work is intended for others.
This is where you are giving what you have learned for the benefit of others.
It is not necessarily final, but it is the culmination of your studies and is the pinnacle of understanding.


# Intro

The atheist asks why there is evil in the world,
saying it's existence surely means there cannot be a God because an omniscient, omnipotent being could not possibly allow it.
The reason (from Genesis 2-3) there is evil is because there man has dominion in the Earth and man is depraved.
A more pertinent question is, why there is any good in the world.
There is no physical or mental basis for it.
There is no substrate of the universe that can account for goodness.
Yet we see the effects of good.
As believers we, not denying the war beneath, acknowledge that God imbues good in the world through His charity.
His desire is to have as many as possible adopted into His family but that process is necessarily fraught with mess because of the delegations to His creatures.

We have the same dichotomy in the story of Jacob.
Charles Spurgeon said, "the mystery is not that God hated Esau, but that God loved Jacob."
Jacob was not a "good" guy: he was a schemer and manipulator, entitled, selfish, and opportunistic.

But God chose him to underrow the future nation of Israel.
God orchestrated the events of His life and blessed him to that end.
We should be eternally grateful because that is the machine that brought the gospel to us.
God loves us and has pierced the darkness for as many as possible and shaped us to include us in his work.
This creation and re-creation forms our identity.
The struggle with evil in and around us is our crisis.


# Identity & Crisis

Identity literally means "sameness".
When we talk about our "identity" we are really expressing the perception of our true nature.
We do this by _identifying_ the various things we are the same as.
The aggregate of these things is our "identity".

  For instance: I am a human, the same as other humans;  I am male, the same as other males;  I am American, the same as other Americans.
However, not all humans have ten fingers or two legs.
Regardless of that we perceive (rightly) a _human_ sameness despite the differences that make us distinguishable.
I am male because of my genetic structure.
However, my genetic structure is unique and does not share many properties with other male humans.
Likewise, I am American because I was born in an American territory.
This citizenship is not unqiue and I do not share many other identifying characteristics with other Americans.

  It is not only important to understand what identity is metaphysically but that its discovery elevates and illuminates our purpose.
Whatever it is we were made to do is both constrained by, and enhanced by, our identity.
Put another way- understanding our identity shines light on who we truly are, how we may interact with others, and how we deal with life.

Crisis literally means "turning point".
It was originally a Greek medical term referring to the _turning point_ in a disease.
e.g. that point in a flu where the fever may break...or not.  The patient is on the verge of recovery or death.
A crisis of identity is that point where we discover something about ourselves that is unsettling.
That unsettled feeling is always a precursor to change, for better or worse.
This is actually a good thing.
There can be no courage with fear.
There can be no accumulation without struggle.


# Nature / Nurture

The story of Jacob reveals many things.
Here we will look at the providential development of his identity, character, and ability.
Regarding the question of whether identity is formed by nature or nurture, the answer is...yes.
We have talents and genes imbued by our creator.
We also have skills and knowledge input by experience.


## Genesis 25

  Jacob is a twin.
In utero he struggled with his brother and a prophecy was given [v.23] that these were two nascent nations and the younger would rule the older.
This fact was providentially decided yet the declaration of it shaped Rebekah's attitude toward her sons.
The natural thing is the proclivity of the boys to struggle.
The nurture element is the treatment of the boys.

  Jacob means `usurper`.
Naming a child thus puts certain expectations on him.
They were raised in accordance with the parents expectation.
However, they also had tendencies: Esau was a macho outdoorsman, Jacob was a studious homebody.
Jacob's first usurpation comes when Esau is famished.
Jacob demands Esau's birthright in exchange for food and Esau agrees.
In this we see Jacob's character in action.
He is immature but acting according to who he is and how is being raised.
He is an opportunist, taking advantage of a situation for personal gain.


## Genesis 27

  Mother knows best.
This saying is loaded but we can take it [here] to mean that Rebekah is actively influencing events.
Isaac is expiring and ready to give his formal blessing: a right of survivorship which will pass on the headship of the family.
She intervenes and guides Jacob through a process to trick Isaac into blessing him instead of Esau.
This is a formative experience for Jacob but remember that he is already over 40 years old.
He has been brought up in this way of scheming and plotting but Rebekah is also sacrificial [v.13]; she accepts responsibility as she guides him.

  The siblings are ruptured.
Isaac and Rebekah fear for Jacob's safety and send him away.
This is another formative experience for the man.
He will be gone for decades, living with the nagging estrangement from his twin brother.


## Genesis 28

  Jacob goes into the wilderness.
It is not a conincidence that many have met God in the wilderness.
It is when we are apart from the world and vulnerable that we are open to deepest influence by God.
The vision [v.12] sets the stage for Jacob's further development and includes a promise.
Jacob makes a conditional vow to God.
It does not appear that he is looking for a loophole or an exit strategy.
It is more like Jacob acknowledging that God is God if God does what He says He will do.
For [perhaps] the first time Jacob sees the providential orchestration and formation of his life.
God is moving him and, though Jacob cannot know precisely where or how, preserving him.


## Genesis 29

  Jacob arrives in Haran.
In his first encounter with the locals we see him giving direction but the shepherds correct him.
Then we are introduced to Rachel as Jacob swoons.
This is an interesting interplay of Jacob's natural inclinations butting up against reality.
Here, he is no one's favorite son and what he wants will not be handed to him.

  Jacob meets his match in Laban.
Jacob's uncle Laban has a similar character to Rebekah and Jacob- a schemer...and he has been doing it longer.
He is opportunistic, like Jacob, and strikes a deal in a situation he intends to manipulate.
Jacob agrees to work seven years in exchange for a marriage to Rachel.
Laban tricks Jacob by giving his elder daughter, Leah, in the marriage bed.
Jacob is, understandably, shaken and irate.
However, Jacob does wed Rachel a week later and agrees to a subsequent 7 year contract- which he fulfills.
He has the underrowing of God's Spirit and the reminder of a promise of well-being.
Laban is like a mirror to Jacob: he reveals unsavory parts of his character.
Jacob's nature does not fundamentally change, rather it matures.
These events serve to shape his identity.

  The womb war ensures.
Jacob loves Rachel but Leah bears him children.
It is a strange interplay from modern eyes.
However, the necessity of offspring is fundamental and Jacob understands the importance of them.


## Genesis 30

  Jacob works and works.
Jacob fathers children through his two wives and two slaves.
We know that, during this time, he also worked as a shepherd of Laban's flocks.
It is interesting that Jacob is portrayed as a passive participant in the womb wars- he goes to whichever bed he is directed.
This is a departure from the patriarchal cultural norm: Jacob's women have a higher place in his household than is typical (he learned this from his father and grandfather.)

  Jacob grows.
Jacob communicates to Laban his desire to leave.
Laban balks and they strike a deal where Jacob will receive any discolored livestock from the flock.
Laban promptly removes all discolored livestock and moves them away, attempting to force Jacob to stay.
However, Jacob's flocks bear discolored offspring anyway; he specially waters them to attain this effect.
So, we see the providential propogation of the genes favorable to Jacob.
The effect is so monumental that Jacob becomes rich and his cousins accuse him of, somehow, cheating the system.

At this point we can look back and see how God has shaped Jacob through the years.
Only Providence can change a person's identity.
Only Providence can give talents to a person.
However, we must also recognize that knowledge and skills are developing through life experience.
From these come wisdom and aptitude that allow us to apply our nature to reality.

This is why is it nonsense to say things like, "I am a natural-born leader."
Leadership prowess may, very well, depend on natural charisma, intellect, and speech-quality but involves many other skills which can only be developed through time and experience.
When undeveloped people are thrust into leadership too soon because of their natural abilities they tend to flounder or mis-lead because they lack the wisdom and aptitude necessary for the job.

This is also why it is nonsense to say, "I identify as <something>."
We cannot change our identity simply by stating it.
Our identiy is defined by experience and genetics.
To say "I am a male" is to perceive that my genetics correspond with those defined as male.
To say "I am American" is to perceive that my birthplace is commensurate with those denoting such citizenship.

Without this understanding it is impossible for us to know our identity.
It is a thing to be grasped, not a thing to be placed.
It is a thing that is formed by God, not a thing that we create.
In understanding our identity we see that providence is, indeed, the interplay between the actions of multiple beings: many created, one preeminent.
We can also come to a deeper understanding of what God meant in declaring Hisself "I Am".
God is what He is, we are what fundamentals and activity have made us.


# Genesis 31

  Jacob seeks council.
Upon God's prompting Jacob plans his departure and seeks council from his wives.
Laban's machinations have alienated his daughters.
So, their faith in Jacob has been solidified.
Jacob's leadership ability has culminated in the acquisition of wealth and the building of a strong household (though not without it's flaws.)
Jacob's ultimate separation from Laban, whom he enriched, was capped by worship through an acknowledgment of God as "the Fear of Isaac" and a sacrifice.
This is a stark contrast to his separation from Esau, whom he left enraged and blubbering.


# Genesis 32

  Jacob feared his brother.
This is why he sends messengers ahead with gifts to smooth any ruffled feathers.
He also splits his people to avoid being entrapped.
He also sends them off in groups so there will time for the others to escape if any are attacked.
He recognises, v.10, God's incredible blessing throughout and His promise of prosperity.
However, he still plans pragmatically.
Jacob's scheming personality now enables him to deal shrewdly with events while still moving the direction God wants him to.

  Jacob wrestles with God.
It is notable that Jacob pins the incarnation to demand a blessing;
this is akin to discovering a key, foundational truth.
God has already offered the blessing so Jacob is on strong footing- the word of God- to demand it.
Jacob's identity is literally changed via his new name: Israel (meaning "struggles with God".)
From this point on whenever the man acts in accordance with God he is referred to as Israel, otherwise he is Jacob.


# Genesis 33

  Esau loved Jacob.
Jacob sees Esau approaching and fears him.
Esau hugs and kisses him and they weep together.
Jacob buys a new parcel and names it El-Elohe-Israel: God is the God of Israel.
This hearkens back to his prayer in chapter 28- God has done what He said He would do.
Jacob has created a place, a heritage, that is literally descriptive of the providence he recognizes in his life.


# Genesis 34

  Jacob's daughter is taken.
Jacob does not act on the news but waits until his sons return.
His family dynamic, wrought from his leadership, is one of brusque reactions.
The subsequent murderous acts of his sons are a keen insight into their upbringing: they have internalized the scheming reactive nature they were brought up with.
Simeon and Levi forfeit their birthrights by murdering this tribe.
This also creates a potential vulnerability with the surrounding peopls.
Thus, it is up to Providence to preserve the family.


# Genesis 35

  Jacob goes to, and from, Bethel.
At Bethel Jacob purges his household of idols and build another altar.
This is a terrificly mature response to the vulnerability he feels.
This is also the culmination of God's promise to preserve Jacob and return him to his homegrounds.
Rachel dies birthing Benjamin at Bethlehem.
Reuben attempts to overtake Jacob and, thus, forfeits his birthright.
Note: this is why Judah becomes the "first" (Simeon/Levi forfeited by their acts against the locals on Dinah's behalf)


# Genesis 42-44

  The boys level up.
Joseph manipulates his brothers and Judah offers himself.


# Genesis 45-48, Hebrews 11

  Jacob's heart revives.
Jacob learns the good news: Jacob is alive.
He leads the family to Egypt.
Because Israel was useful to Pharaoh, but shepherds were anathema, they are given a land to themselves (Goshen.)

The crux:
  Genesis 47:31- Israel leaned and worshipped.
  Joseph sets up his sons to receive a blessing but Jacob crosses his arms to bless as he sees fit...as he sees how Providence directs.
  His last words are not a theology lesson but a retelling of God's provision to the family.


# Conclusion

Our identity is formed by God but isn't final until our end.
Take comfort that God is deliberately moving us in a way for a reason.
Upon recognizing this we can embrace the work of Providence.
We can expect God to develop us and, one day, deliver us to the goal.
Our purpose is to know God and make Him known.
This is not just a trite witicism but a recognition that we are God's testimony.
His work in our lives is for the advancement of His kingdom by blessing all those we encounter.

Our identity is crafted to evangelize a particular group of people.
There are those whom we can sympathize and empathize with.
They may only understand their depravity, and thus their need for Jesus, through us.
They may be able to accept the message of reconciliation through us.
God has chosen a remnant of humanity to carry be His testimony.
The Spirit has shaped us to fit in a particular space...embrace it.

* What is identity?
  * literally "sameness"
  * metaphysically "we understand our uniqueness by discerning different way we are like others"
    * e.g. human, male, macho... or not
    * Mead: You're unique, just like everyone else.
* What is crisis?
  * etymology "turning point in a disease"
    * i.e. the fever breaks- or not
  * metaphysically: the point where things _will_ change, for better or worse
    * i.e. the wilderness experience

## Identity Crisis

How is it that we know change is coming?

Why are we fearful of change?


What Bible text(s) come to mind talking about who I am?

What is a part of my identity that I was unaware of? or not in touch with?


# Imagery

Imagery ~ the formation of a representation of something

Hyperbole ~ an exaggeration of something mundane

Diplomacy ~ management of negotiation between nations

Sojourn ~ temporary residence
# I Am Jonah
# A Book of Opposites
# Providence

God will do what God wants to do.
God wants to reconcile with humanity.

We mistakenly interpret God's past actions as a formula to get what we want from God.
We also mistakenly assume that God will act as He I'm the past in similar circumstances.

* Leaders are not Managers
- where does the ladder go vs how to use it

contact lens story, this is where the light is

apostles & deacons in Acts 6
- to the apostles, service was urgent but not important [to them]


* Leaders make problems smaller

Charles Spurgeon: "They may peach the gospel better, but they do not peach a better gospel."


* Leaders are humble

John Wesley vs George Whitefield
- these men, both leaders in their camp, were publicly conflicted regarding pre-destination

“It is said that when Wesley and Whitefield were at odds on theology and ecclesiastical matters, one of Wesley’s adherents asked him, “Do you think we shall see Mr. Whitefield in heaven?” “No,” he answered, “I do not. I think he will be so near the Throne, and you and I so far away, that we shall not get within sight of him.” {From The Pastor amidst His Flock G. B. Wilcox 1890}

The desire for preeminence is the death knell of usefulness. Alistair Begg


real leadership is uncommon

The most improper job of any man, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity. J.R.R. Tolkien


leaders execute

Mon centre cède, ma droite recule, situation excellente, j'attaque. Ferdinand Foch

... deliberately

... against odds
The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.

the probability of success is a factor, but not the only factor, and not the most important factor


leaders lift others

A grandfather talking to his young grandson tells the boy he has two wolves inside of him, struggling with each other: The first is the wolf of peace, love and kindness. The other is the wolf of fear, greed and hatred. "Which wolf will win, grandfather?" asks the boy. The grandfather replied, "Whichever one you feed."

	"What John tells us, in point of fact, is that Jesus approached the grave of Lazarus, in a state, not of uncontrollable grief, but of irrepressible anger.  He did respond to the spectacle of human sorrow abandoning itself to its unrestrained expression, with quiet, sympathetic tears: “Jesus wept” (verse 36).  But the emotion which tore his breast and clamored for utterance was just rage."

Bible Structure

Why the prevalence of 6s in the Bible's structure?  6 is...?the number of man?

What is the significance of 2383?  is the number of words given below accurate?

If the chaper/verse numberings are not inspired, then why are there so many patterns therein?

	Theory 1: (mine) because the underlying text is inspired of the greatest being, and we are designed to perceive and understand patterns, we naturally see these patterns in His work.

	Theory 2: (mine) the Scripture is structured in such a high-level way that any arrangement of it evokes patterns.

Note: there are some OT books that are divided differently by the Jews.

Why are there patterns in the Bible?
	1) God is proving His sovreignty by installing patterns within and between books that could not have been done by man.
	2) Proverbs 25:2
	3) It makes the Bible a self-verifying entity (an infinite designer would imbue infinite complexity within infinite elegance)

	claims that Isaiah has multiple authors
		chapters 1-39
		chapters +
	Jesus disproves this
		John 12:38
			Isaiah said
			= Is 53:1
		John 12:40
			'again' Isaiah said
			= Is 6:10
	Coincidentally
		we now have 39 chapters OT, 27 NT

# Forgiveness


Why don't we seek forgiveness?
- we don't know we need it
  - we are anesthetized or ignorant
  - we are afraid

... We don't need to be afraid,
look what God did with Manasseh or Saul

How does God forgive?
- completely
- immediately
- repeatedly
- inherently [Matt 6:14-15]

God doesn't tolerate evil, he displaces it 
Good doesn't wink at sin, he removes it.

A Man After God's Own Heart


Why does the Spirit refer to David was the "man after God's own heart"?
	{1Sam 13:14}	{Acts 13:22}
  David grieved the death of his enemy. {2Sam 1:17+}
  David forgave
  David was loyal to a king that hated him, a king that was disowned by God and was not worthy of the throne
  David's heart was _wholly_ God's {1Kgs 15:3}


David & Samuel
	{1Chr 29:29}
	{1Sam 16}
		David was working while the others were presented to the seer.
		David was anointed "in the midst of his brothers"
		The Spirit of the LORD _rushed_ upon David ~ "from that day forward"
			he certainly did wrong, but never lost the Spirit
	{1Sam 19}
		While David was serving his king, Saul, as a personal musician he was attacked by Saul and ran away
			He was assisted [saved] by Saul's daughter, his wife, Michal
			He fled to Samuel, in Ramah, and told him everything Saul had done
			...then they both and lived together in Naioth
	{1Sam 25}
		After Samuel's death David went into the wilderness
	{1Chr 9:22}
		David & Samuel established the office of gatekeepers
	{1Chr 11:3}
		With Samuel's support the elders made a covenant with, and anointed, David


David & Nathan
	{1Chr 29:29}
	{2Sam 7:1-17}
		God encouraged David, via Nathan, to prepare for building the temple
		Nathan also delivered the pledge of David's eternal throne
	{2Sam 9:1-15}
		Nathan delivers a devastating message from God to David
		...but "The LORD also has put away your song;"

## Remember
~ XCR, mnysthyna, mnemonic
- God does not forget, He recalls the to the present
- Remembering is bringing things to the present in the context of human existence
- Or, recalling to the forefront a thing whose time has come
- We remember when prompted by an association; God remembers when He brings forward
  - a modern analogy: a computer does not forget data, it is stored and is recalled when the program is loaded; God's events are like a timed event which runs the program which recalls the data
- Memory and remembrance is only significant in the human paradigm; i.e. within time.  It is not a valid concept in the divine realm.

Congregational worship is the purpose of the Church.  We can worship by giving a gift, sitting in a hospital waiting room, or singing to each other about the Master.  We can also worship by vehemently keeping a schedule, uniting in hatred of the Enemy, and extoling each others virtues.  Of course, the former are what we ought to encourage within the congregation.  However, as I watch events unfold if we aren't really driving toward the latter.

Music serves to open our selves up.  It creates the conduit through which doctrine can flow.  This is why words are so important: once opened we must fill our selves with good stuff.  This is also why we must sing to each other: it is proof and provision of the Spirit - His similar work in the lives of others.
	{1Pet 4:10} But music is only one piece of the puzzle.  A servant may begin worshipping by setting up chairs, an administrator may begin worshipping by planning events and sharing that with others, a giver may begin worshipping by dropping an envelope in the plate, a teacher may begin to worship by giving a Word.  The Worship Leader is truly in charge of this menagerie.
	Furthermore, those who lead ought to do so with skill so as not to distract.  Excellence, in Biblical terms, means A) appointing one skilled to do the work {1Chr 15:22}, and B) performing with such skill that they do not distract themselves or others {Ex 31:3}{Ex 35:35}{Ps 33:3}.

It is important to draw the distinction between music and song.  Song is the content which is deposited by the music.  One thing we do well is curating songs.
	There has been much discussion regarding musical styles.  This is moot until we reconcile issues with technology and order of service.  The greatest disctraction has been the sound from the amplification system.  Neither is it trivial that we begin with a subdued announcer, then [expectantly] a high-energy song, then a seminary lecture (:~)...this roller coaster ride has an effect and sends a message.
	Assuming we traverse that marsh (which is a good assumption), we do have musical issues.  These issues are humility and energy.  Humility can only be learned or milled: i.e. modeled by leadership or being ground into pulp and re-baked.  This modeling is non-existent.  Energy comes from direction (worship leader) and comfort.  Musicians must practice, whether you hold them accountable [or not] is another matter, in order to be comfortable and __undistracted__ in the service.
	My opinion: the church should engage aleatory music.  Pre-written, strictly codified music is too constraining for non-professional musicians (requiring precise conjunctions throughout the service).  This is paradigm shift that closely follows the practice but requires a much different focus.

The congregation should have a choir (opining).  This is not a performing choir but, rather, a group of people who love to sing and are willing to meet in order to learn songs and singing.  A choir practice would look like this:
	1. Lesson on the doctrine of worship, singing, or music
	2. Exposition of doctrines in our songs' lyrics
	3. Discussion of the usage of the songs in worship = when & why they are used
	4. Learn & practice our songs with harmonies and variations

Another opinion: all spoken content should be curated.  We already curate songs, we should also curate prayers and calls to worship.  This does two things: it calms the nerves (which most of us get) and it ensures good content.  Of course this can't be a hard-n-fast rule because some people are very good at extemporaneous speaking/praying.  But, Heaven forbid that we assume that prayers and calls to worship must be impromptu!

Martin Luther and Keith Getty both hold singing as the primary congregational teaching tool.  Martin-Lloyd Jones and Bob Kauflin always chose the songs for their services.
	I reject the usage of the title "Worship Leader" for anyone but an elder.  In 1st Chronicles 15-16 David takes the role of the Worship Leader.  This encompasses far more than music or song.  It also requires far more maturity and implies stricter standards for life and personal doctrine.

## Mmhmm

Finally, as I have shared with both of you: I perpetually struggle with pride in this area because I believe myself to be capable of serving in this area of song leader yet I was not chosen to do so.  Moreover it baffles me why you selected someone as Worship Leader who is neither a capable musician nor leader.  Our Sovereign is easefully in control but decisions and the ramifications thereof are ours.
	I sit by and watch this man make crass, inappropriate jokes in the fellowship, argue with fellow team members, and never provide spiritual leadership.  My wonder is this: Am I wrong (that did happen once)?  Am I the only one who notices?  Or, is everyone else simply willing to accept it?
	Hopefully, the answer is that I am so concentered on self that my mind invents problems so as to make sense of my feelings and that schemes for glory.  But there are more and more niggles that wholly remind me of corporate power struggles and nepotism rather than the familiar flow of events and wonder of a divine appointment.
You are my pastors: set me straight!

His Unfamiliar Face
A Biblical Mystery:

by Chuck Missler • March 1, 1999

22
Print this article

After Jesus' resurrection, why did people always seem to have difficulty recognizing Him? We can't help but notice something strange about Jesus' post-resurrection appearances.

Sunday Morning

That early Sunday morning, even Mary fails to recognize Jesus at first.1 She mistakes Him for the gardener-until she hears His voice. She was no casual acquaintance: a few days earlier she washed His feet with her tears! Why didn't she know who He was until she heard His voice? It seems that "Mary!" prompted her recognition.2

Sunday Afternoon

Later that afternoon, Jesus joined two disciples on the Emmaus Road, and for seven miles He gives them an Old Testament Bible study.3

Although "their eyes were holden that they should not know Him," the Bible doesn't really explain what this means.4 In any case, they did recognize Him when He broke the bread at dinner. (This itself is odd, since it was the role of the host-not the guest-to break the bread.) Their tip-off was in viewing the nail prints in His hands. (They confirmed this later that evening.)

Sunday Evening

These two disciples join the gathering that evening in the upper room and confirm His appearance, emphasizing that it was in the breaking of the bread that they realized who He was.5 Why not during the seven-mile walk? What is going on here?

When Jesus ultimately emerges in their midst, we find them all terrified.6 Astonished, of course, but why frightened? For some reason they don't recognize Him until they examine His wounds! Why?

The Galilean Breakfast

Perhaps the most puzzling thing occurs later at the Sea of Galilee.7 When they join Him for that early morning breakfast on the seashore, John makes the strangest remark: "And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord."8 What does that mean?

A Possible Clue

We should remember that the Bible is a single, integrated message -- 66 books, penned by over 40 authors over thousands of years, but in which every detail is there by supernatural engineering. Thus, we also need to recognize that:

the New Testament is in the Old Testament concealed;

the Old Testament is in the New Testament revealed.

There are many surprising insights and details in the Old Testament which amplify the New, including some astonishing physical descriptions.

A familiar example is Psalm 22, which reads as if it were dictated by Jesus Himself as He hung on the cross. He describes His pain, the piercing of His hands and feet;9 He quotes the taunts of the crowd10 and observes the parting of His clothes,11 etc. The Psalm even opens and closes with His first and final words from the cross.12

Another such passage is Isaiah 53.13 This passage, sometimes called "The Holy of Holies of the Old Testament," highlights the implications of the cross as eloquently as any of Paul's epistles. In Isaiah 52:14, however, it specifies that the extent of the abuse left Jesus hardly even looking human.

Yet another most disturbing detail appears a page earlier:

I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. Isaiah 50:6
This seems to indicate that the Roman soldiers ripped off His beard! No wonder His friends had trouble recognizing Him!

I had an occasion some years ago to work with a software specialist who wore a very full beard. One day he came to work with it shaved off. I almost didn't recognize him! It is surprising what a difference a single feature like that can make.

(And this didn't involve any scar tissue or other evidences of abuse resulting from treatment received at the hands of vicious Roman soldiers.)

An Emblem of Love

I am reminded of a young mother whose face was badly disfigured. Her little girl was continually ridiculed by the children in school because of her mother's appearance. (You know how cruel children can be.)

When the little girl was old enough, the mother explained to her that when she was a baby there was a dreadful fire in the apartment and, although the mother was able to save the little girl, the mother herself suffered very severe burns in the process. From that day on, the little girl was no longer embarrassed about her mother. Every time she looked into her mother's face it was a reminder of just how much she was loved.

Is it possible that, in addition to the nail prints, there were additional scars-perhaps where His beard used to be-that caused their difficulty in recognizing Him? Are they still there? Does Jesus still bear the marks of His humiliation?

In the Book of Revelation, John is propelled forward in time some several thousand years and is granted a vision of the throne of God. In Revelation 5 we find "the lamb as it had been slain," apparently still bearing the scars of the cross.14 They say that the only man-made things in heaven are His scars.

When Jesus returns to rule Israel, He proclaims, "And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced."15

The marks of His humiliation are also the marks of His glory. Furthermore, I'm sure the most significant aspects of the cross were not the physical or physiological aspects. I believe it will take us an eternity to even begin to understand what it cost Him that we might be with Him.

He was born of a woman so that we could be born of God.
He humbled Himself so that we could be lifted up.
He became a servant so that we could be made co-heirs.
He suffered rejection so that we could become His friends.
How precious our Redeemer is! Have you really thanked Him lately?

A servant leader anticipates the needs of his followers and weighs to enable a solution in advance.

The ultimate example of this is Jesus Christ: God foresaw human depravity and made a solution for it.

Dan 2:31-35Unbelief


The mere fact that Psalms 37, 53, 73, 78, and 106 were written, not to mention the hymns "Begone Unbelief" (Newton) and "Help My Unbelief" (Gadsby), tells me that I'm not alone in disbelieving at times and having my faith shaken.
David, the man after God's own heart, disbelieved {1 Sam 27:1}.
I have experienced God to extents that give me chills when remembering yet I still disbelieve at times.

A teacher of mine used to say, "the fact that you're worried about it means you don't have to worry about it."
It's somewhat trite...but true.
There would not be such a great fight, nor inner turmoil, if there were no spiritual battle being fought.
To paraphrase Descartes: "we could not imagine righteous God if He had not given us the ability to do so."

I like the analogy of life as a climbing path up a rock face.
Periodically a piton is driven in to break a fall - and there will be falls.
The more of these anchor points there are the better off we are in a fall - if one gives way it will slow the momentum for the next piton to catch us.

Life experiences and profound lessons create these anchor points.
As a youngster we fail more often and don't have the confidence of looking down to see many pitons.
The bottom One will always hold...but sometimes that fact must be tested.
After all, we cannot truly know a thing without experience.

The danger is that we mistake our experiences for reality.
This is mystical fallacy and it's fruit is legalism or license.
[2Pet 1:10] ~ we are instructed to obtain security, and this is wraught through _practicing_ good character.
The goal is to have the assurance of faith that comes from Him by knowing Him by seeking to imitate Him.

Untrustworthy Leadership


{Heb 13:7} - Don’t trust leaders who can’t get the job done, even if they are wonderful people.

It takes more than good character to be a trustworthy leader. Don’t trust leaders who can’t get the job done, even if they are wonderful people.

An incompetent leader — who tells the truth — is an untrustworthy leader. {1Tim 4:16}

{Ez 34}


7 sources of untrustworthy leadership:
 1. Inexperience

 2. Ignorance

 3. Neglect

 4. Incompetence

 5. Selfish intent

 6. Lack of character

 7. Immaturity

Untrustworthy leaders:
 1. Don’t trust themselves. They change their mind when  they should stay the course.

 2. Minimize difficulties.

 3. Don’t know when to quit or change course. They lead into dead ends and failure.

 4. Run around with their finger in the air, seeing which way the wind blows. There’s a difference between listening to follow and listening to lead.

 5. Dangle carrots. They promise promotions but don’t deliver, for example.

 6. Lack compassion.

 7. Are ungrateful and bitter.

 8. Never apologize.

 9. Lack emotional control.

 10. Don’t trust others.

 11. Keep you guessing about what they really want.

 12. Lack transparency and candor. Don’t trust leaders who won’t tell you what they think.

 13. Get lost in the weeds and lose sight of long-term goals and purpose.

 14. Disconnect. Don’t trust isolated leaders who keep others at arms-length.

 15. Bury their head in the sand. Don’t trust leaders who won’t confront brutal facts.

 16. Reject feedback.

 17. Defend rather than explore.

 18. Hold others accountable but let themselves off the hook.

 19. Don’t stand up for others.

 20. Act like they didn’t screw up when they did.


5 ways to deal with untrustworthy leaders:
 1. Establish if they are a know-it-all. There’s no hope for someone who thinks they know when they don’t.

 2. Determine if the issue is character or competence. Remove leaders who lack character.

 3. Maximize their strengths.

 4. Compensate for their weaknesses.

 5. On a personal level, continue doing a great job, but protect yourself.


You might be a good person, but are you a trustworthy leader?

How do you spot untrustworthy leaders?

How do you deal with untrustworthy leaders?

The Book of Mark

9:30-32) Lessons in Galilee
	Prophecy I
	__They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,  for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.”  But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.__

9:33-37) Lessons in Capernaum
	Leadership
	__And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”  But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.  And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”  And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them,  “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.”__

	Inclusivity
	__John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name,[fn] and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”  But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.  For the one who is not against us is for us.  For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.__


	__“Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,[fn] it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.  And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell,[fn] to the unquenchable fire.[fn]  And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.  And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,  ‘where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.’  For everyone will be salted with fire.[fn]  Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”__

	Children Lesson
	10:13-16) __And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them.  But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.  Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”  And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.__

	Rich or Not
	10:17-31) __And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”  And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is[fn] to enter the kingdom of God!  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”  And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him,[fn] “Then who can be saved?”  Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”  Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.”  Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,  who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.  But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”__

	Dereprobation
	Prophecy II
	10:32-34) __And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him,  saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.  And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.”__

	Conceit
	10:35-45) __And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”  And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”  And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”  Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”  And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized,  but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”  And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John.  And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.  But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,[fn]  and whoever would be first among you must be slave[fn] of all.  For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”__

Jericho
	Sight
	10:46-52) __And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.  And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”  And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”  And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.”  And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.  And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabbi, let me recover my sight.”  And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way.__Whom Beloved


The shadowy figure known as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” appears in five scenes in the Gospel of John (John 13:21-30, John 18:15-18, John 19:26-27, John 21:7 with John 21:20), though some also regard the unnamed disciple in John 1:35-39 as the beloved disciple.

Wife


A wife who's husband went to war has an empty space in her bed.  But that space has meaning and is expected to be filled.  This is the faith of the bride.The wilderness is an unholy place - often associated with the demonic.  e.g. the Azazel goat (which, after one came home, they would take to the wilderness and push it over a cliff).  
At the risk of being presumptuous (though it's not really much of a risk) I would like to share what I have learned at the T4G conference.  This relates to our corporate worship which I believe it to be of vital importance.

Worship
  Congregational worship is comprised of preaching, readings/confessions, singing, and prayer (in order of intimacy.)  We do all of these things faithfully.  However, none of these should be impromptu (and only extemporaneously based on the skill of the provider.)

Curation
  1. Prayers should should be pre-written or planned in advance (read from the Bible or a book of prayers.)  In my not-so-humble opinion: only elders should pray unless it is scripted.
  2. Songs are teaching tools and, thus, should selected based on their theological content.  This means either songs that are directly from scripture (word for word) or are world-class, inspired poetry.  There is an immense wealth of material such that we should never lack for lyrics from any topic.  We do this already but I believe we need to learn to divorce the lyrics from the music in making selections.
  3. Material must be curated prior to use by the assembly.  This might mean a hymnal or prayer-book of our own; or rules by which to select such material.

Singing
  Martin Luther and Keith Getty both hold singing to be a primary congregational teaching tool.  

Music
  Music serves to support the congregation in singing.  It's purpose is to encourage and enable people to sing.  Unsung music is almost always pointless in a worship service.  Likewise, musicians should be chosen who are of sufficient skill so as to 1) not distract from Worship and 2) guide the singing.
  As there has been much discussion regarding musical styles I think it's important to remember that A) this depends heavily on the music leader and musicians and B) music is a tertiary issue; order of worship and logistics are much more important, secondary, issues in a Worship service.

Training
  The congregation needs to sing.  The congregation needs to be taught how to sing.
  I think an embedded choir should be established which meets regularly and is composed of anyone who loves to sing.  It's purpose would be to learn songs and then stand distributed among the congregation to help them learn songs.  This happens thusly via a choir "director":
    1. Exposition of doctrine and theology within a song's lyrics
    2. Discussion of when/why a particular song is used in a Worship service
    3. General ongoing discussions on the doctrine of worship and why we sing
    4. Learn the music with harmonies and variations

What is God's greatest achievement?
There are two ways to measure this:
1. How much revelation is devoted to it.
2. How much did it cost Him.

e.g. Creation
1. First part of Genesis; a few Psalms; some sections here & there.
2. He "breathed it out".

im. Redemption
1. Most of the Book.
2. His son.

The Homechurch Manifesto


Excepting my desert period I have always been in a leadership position in institutions of the Church: late in high school and early college I was the assistant youth pastor, later in college I helped to plant a church and became a licensed gospel minister and part of an itinerant worship band, after the desert I was again a worship leader and deacon candidate.
I hope that that is a fair and succinct backgrounding for the reader of this document; because, as with Scripture, getting into the author's head is supremely important.
That is, in fact, the truest meaning of context in literature.

In penultimate fairness: I was kicked out of the first position and quit the other two.
At the time(s) I could expound on the reasons why these fissures manifested.
But it was only after the latest one that I deliberately dug for the roots.
I have come to discover that the institutionalized Church is hopelessly broken and inept.

This is not a discussion about denominations or worship styles.
The fact is that any incorporated congregation lands in a circular rut where clergy serve laity who (being human) have no pressure or will to exercise their aptitude.
Many have found themselves at best numb to, at worst disgusted by, this process.
Those people are leaving the institutions and, to their shame, the institutionalized are saying good riddance.

The purpose of this document is to explore what the Church is, how the Church acts, and how the Church looks.
It is important to define terms (as I have had to retrain myself to speak rightly about these matters).
The Church is all who are ransomed by the blood of Jesus Christ...now and ever.
A congregation is any gathering of Church members larger than one nuclear family.
It is Biblically incorrect to say, "I goto Church at ...".
We do not goto Church, we are the Church.
The Church is the sacred space where Yehovah deals with men.
God is one being far beyond our imagining who has chosen to reveal Himself to us as the Trinity:
  A holy Father who is unapproachable by any sinful being.
  The Word that became human to die in our place to pay our sins' ransom and rule over all.
  Spirit that holds all things together and works through His believers via indwelt power.

This document is not being written to confound the Church or challenge denominationalism.
There is no new information herein, just a synthesis that i couldn't find elsewhere.
I believe that the gifts of the Spirit are not fully expressible in the institutionalized Church.
I believe the blood of Christ is inaccessible in the institutionalized Church.
I believe that the Father is unsearchable in the institutionalized Church.
To me this is plain as daylight: born-again believers (truest Church members) are sitting idle in institutions - which was never the plan for us.  Non-believers thrive in the institutions.  People cling to their human institutions like prisoners with Stockholm syndrome.
The most natural setting for Church-work is in the home.


The Greatest Gifts
------------------
Faith
Hope
Love
[1Cor 13]


The Gathering Purpose
---------------------
[Acts 2:42] - each piece has a purpose for the giver and two types of recipients, saved and unsaved.

Teaching
Fellowship
Commensality
Prayer


"What the cross is to Jesus, the meal is to the Church."

Commensality = eating together
~ Very important!


Adullam
-------
The Good Parts
[Acts 2:46]
[Acts 20:20]

The Scary Parts
= untrained or unaccountable leaders
[Jam 3:1]
[2Tim 2:15]
[2Tim 3:14-16]

The Benefits of Large Meetings
~ elders [Tts 1:5-9] [Tts 2:3-5]


The gifts make so much more sense in the context of home/family type meetings.

We often see gifts not being employed in the instiutionalized Church because it is designed for the Church to spectate the clergy.
	e.g. where are the Titus 2 women?  We have older women in our congregation who are not discipling the younger women ~ it is no that don't want to but that the institution prevents it (because they feel beholden to it, i.e. if it does not move them they do not move).

Yehovah grows His Church much like the congregation at the cave of Adullam
	[1Chr 11]
	[1Sam 22]
	[1Sam 23]
	? [Mic 1:15]
	? [Neh 11:30]
	?? [Gen 38]
	?? [Josh 12:35]


Recruitment is {entirely} unnecessary.

The Church is like a number of sheep folds within a great pasture.

	It is possible to make a valid, evangelical, textual defense of a local or global flood.

Bottom line: such arguments cannot be used to demonstrate a person's committment to inspiration or allegiance to Yahweh.
We must remember that the Bibilical authors had a [completely] different paradigm.


[Gen 10]
	There are 70 nations listed here
	It is invalid to assume that this is an exhaustive list of nations on the entire globe, but that is the wording here
	...therefore, we understand that terms like "whole earth" are not geographic but ?synedoche? (some figure of speech)

[Joel 2:28]
	Yahweh's Spirit shall be poured out on "all flesh"
	...does this mean everyone partakes in the Spirit?
		No, we know this from practical experience and [1Cor 3:16]
		Now, might this refer to a time when Yahweh is revealed afer the new creation?
		...if so then why must there be visions and dreams, this seems to imply a time where there is active evangelism

"O, Love that will not let me go..." _George Matheson_


The phrase, "God answers prayer" belies a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of prayer.
What is astounding is that such a fundamental error does not negate one's belief - but it does hamper the walk.

Prayer is a community, literally being in proximity to God.
What is interesting is that He is always close to us [1Cor 3] but we are not always "close" to Him.
How do we resolve this dichotomy?
The answer is in the notion of sacred space.
The past-tense of salvation was the propogation of the sacred space into the believer.
The present-tense of salvation is the sacramental cleansing of the sacred space - santification.
The future-tense of salvation is the nexus of our old and new lives.

The sacrifices of the old testament were propitiatory but not eternal - in fact they were quite limited in timespan.
There was a continual need to be preparing the sacred space for sacrifice, not to mention the logistics of attaining, transporting, and performing the sacrifice.
The sacrifice is not the thing given but the process by which we stand before God and move with Him in a prescribed manner.Body Temple

The point here is that the new testament writers understood the living allegory of the Church as the temple.
This may imply the Ezekiel's temple is not a literal temple
1. There are no height dimensions given
2. The imagers as the temple is a Biblical concept
3. The cosmic mountain theme ties the temple to the greater, incorporeal, spiritual war

[Eze 43:13-17]

Levinson states that the creation account (esp. [Gen 2]) is akin to a cosmic temple building project
...notable in light of the Church/temple paradigm

i.e. the glory of Christ is in the body, we are the body, which is the cosmic mountain, via which He runs His redemption program

[Rev 21,22] ~ no temple in heaven


[Lev 25:8-10] ~ 50yr Jubilee

	[Eze 40:1]
	Two things link Ezekiel's temple to the Jubilee:
	- the Jubilee began on 10 Tishri
	- 25th year

1 Tishri =
	birth of Jesus

  Gives the ultimate type of the serpent but this would have been a mystery to the Mosaic Israelites.
# Brother's Keeper

In my not-so-humble opinion: there is not greater concern in the Church today than the utter lack of pastoring.
It is evident in tepid, untrained, unfaithful flocks who wander about in distress at the whim of moralism and acultishness.

But a shepherd is not a person that can be trained up.
Pastoring is a spiritual gift alongside characters that have been distilled and smelted through the pressures and fires of life.
Pastoring has nothing, per se, to do with Biblical eldership.
Being a pastor does not imply that one has the _gift_ of teaching.
Pastors are not always gifted preachers.

To an extent, the best sense we can make of this topic is to examine earlier saints whose flocks loved them to death.
Tales abound of apostles and reformers whose congregations adored them and loved them through intense trials and persecutions.
All who are pastors must surely have dreamt of nurturing a flock into that kind of love relationship.
It is not a desire for adulation but an earnest plea for familial cloesness.
It is in the deep places of the heart that spiritual gifts are instantiated.
If the gift is pastoring then it will be expressed through relationships that build the Church and nourish communicants.

Those who are pastors in title only are at best outletting their true gifts [other than pastoring].
At worst they are seeking fulfillment in an incorrect manner.
It is a shame that Church has allowed such people to go unchecked.
In a way it is a spiral towards 
# But if Not

[Dan 3]
Calvinism


The Doctrines of Grace
"TULIP"

Total Depravity
	original sin

Unconditional Election

Limited Atonement
	particular atonement

Irresistible Grace
	
Perseverance of the Saints
	"once saved always saved"
	soteriological security


The main issue for the modern Church is: none of these doctrines should be divisive.
But they are.
Even "once saved...always..." need not be a doctrinally divisive issue; it's sad to see a brother/sister fret over security but it doesn't preclude fellowship.
Really, the only dogmatic philosophies are those which are Christological (Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection) because they undergird our need for salvation and His provision of it.
Causality

There is an interesting natural law which governs the maximum speed of a thing.
This maximum speed is necessary to ensure that causality is preserved.

Censorship vs. Curation
	data-oriented eldership


It's difficult to know how much to lockdown a child.  Some parents take a lassez-faire approach to their stewardship.  Others are very strict.  It should be difficult for us to fault either because A) we are not them and B) our children are not theirs.
	From a teliological basis of Yahweh's providence over parenting we must conclude that He knit together the family in the same way he knit together our bodies [Ps 139] and the Church [Eph 1].  i.e. He gave you what children he did on purpose.
	From a theological perspective is it also true that being raised in a family is the most formative event in a human life.  Second to that is parenting.  This is true no matter what form the family takes - deformations, defects, and divisions abound.

All that to say that it may be best to withhold access to certain information from your child.  Or, perhaps, your child may be edified and wizened by information that would damage another child.  This is a conundrum that cannot be solved by a purely scholarly work - suffice it to say that there must involvement by other people.
	However, an issue we can resolve is the _manner_ in which this information is withheld.  There are two pieces involved here: access and intent.

Access comes in two forms (from a geek perspective): black-list and white-list.  In short
- Black-list ~ you are allowed to see everything except what is on the list
- White-list ~ you are only allowed to see what is on the list
	Hopefully it obvious that the first is reactive and the second is intensive.  It is possible to employ a mix of these two by categorizing information.
	Also, practically speaking, we tend to implement access control using both because we can never fully anticipate needs nor fully encapsulate data.

Intent is the reason for providing the information.  Are we teaching?  Are we simply allowing them some recreation?
	Intent must be deliberate or we risk opening the floodgates and being inundated via our own control scheme.
	Further, intent dictates our involvement with the act of information absorption as well.  A child is not necessarily capable of taking in information beneficially - neither are they necessarily capable of drawing truthful conclusions from it (neither are you either (necessarily)).


Now we have a foundation on which to distinguish censorship and curation.  First, lay out your presuppositions: given your ability to do so is it ever prudent to completely remove a piece of information (book, video) from your child's existence?  i.e. If you could would you eliminate you son's access to pornography for all time?
	Further, is that potentially damaging information which you ought to present to your child before someone else does?  I think that's obvious as well.  Issues like intelligent design and sex and illicit drug-use must be brought forward by the parent _first_.

Censorship is merely the removal of information.  It is blocking internet addresses and burning books.  It is not, ever, ultimately successful.  Generally information is never really lost and confidential things breed covetousness.

Curation, on the other hand, is a metering of experience.  The steward decides what and when to present to the one under their care.  Curation is just as deliberate as censorship but is regressive rather than final.  Eventually the child will be independent and will have access to all the information you withheld.  The great question is: will they desire to go after the things which are damaging?
	The answer to that question lies in the method you chose to employ in providing them data.  Without a purposeful methodology with the goal of their benefit that answer will likely be yes.
# Choosing a church


The central message of a ministry is _defining_.

Typical congregations today are not heterdox - they don't have enough theological depth to **be** heretical.

For the Church fathers all subjects were subservient to Christology.
- NOT self-improvement
- NOT foretelling the future


Haramatiology and saving faith are important foundational topics necessary for good Christology.


There is an important distinction between a "transformation of sinners" and the Person and work of Christ.
The latter must be at the forefront of a good ministry.

The distinction is that we are to focus on Christ whose work which granted us great favor.

# Consciousness

= a framework with which we can model our world.

Consciousness is given to, not created by, us.

Consciousness is closely related to spirituality ~ the notion that there is a transcendental portion of man.

Creativity is the sole differentiator between soulish and truly spiritual creatures.

# Contradiction

Non-contradiction is necessary for rational thought.

Some apparent contradictions reveal misunderstanding or unattainable paradigms.

e.g. Light
    Under certain circumstances light behaves like a particle.
    Under other circumstances lights behaves like a wave.
    It is neither, we simply lack framework to fully understand it.

Interestingly, light is something beyond understanding until we measure it - then it behaves in a particular way that we do understand.

Reason and doubt are compatible with faith.

Nothing is withheld from us that we conceived to do.

Some have a propensity to dismiss their intuition and instinct - both Christians and Atheists, for different reasons.
The former believes it to be a base, unfit residual from the _old man_.
The latter believes it to be a vestigial leftover from a lesser ancestor.
Both are wrong for the same reason: these are innate abilities programmed into us.
# Crisis
~ from the same Greek word,
  the root of which is `krie` ~ to sieve, a mechanism of separation
...decisive point in the progress of a disease
...a point at which change is coming, for better or worse

The change may be recovery or death.


A German term for "mid-life crisis" is Torschlusspanik, literally "shut-door-panic," fear of being on the wrong side of a closing gate.


When a crisis comes change will happen.
Fear often accompanies our predelection of the change;
But, without fear there is no opportunity for courage.
Often the outcome results from our expectations.
...which often fall short of what should be.

Ultimately the outcome is determined by the sovereign, one who is in control.

# Disappointment

You cannot disappoint God.  Disappointment comes from unmet expectations.  God foreknows what to expect of us.

We get disappointed because we fabricated expectations and respond according to them.  The pragmatism of the gospel is that God works all things for good.

The ultimate lack of sense is formulating expectations of things we cannot control.  The ultimate deception is that we can control anything apart from God's provision.

# Elder

The word elder refers to an older person - both now and in antiquity.
Life expectancy has greatly increased but that doesn't mean the age of ancient elders was less than it is now: just that there were far fewer of them.

Elder, as a role, refers to a community leader - carrying the implication of old age in the name.

Both 1Peter 5 & Numbers 11 imply a higher mean age among elders than the general Church population.

Biblically, an elder possesses the aforementioned traits as well as character traits laid out in [1Tim 3] & [Tts 1].
Most of those qualifications are straight forward but special attention must be paid to the condition of his wife and children.
These qualifications might be viewed as a winnowing of the crop of elderly into those fit for Church service.  [Num 11]

There is some wiggle room in terms of appointment but it must be consistent.
That consistency does not end with simply appointing the same brand of Elder over and over.
We must also be consistent with Church history.
Biblical leadership appointments were never given to youngsters.
It is interesting that, at Stephen's stoning, the Bible records that Saul was a "young man".  [Acts 7:58]
Brash young Jacob was put through the ringer whereas Israel, advanced in years, saw his providential appointment and "worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff."  [Gen 47:31] [Heb 11:21]

Further, the notion of appointment is not that we create rulers.
Rather, it is discovering them in our midst; alongside us.

A side-effect of old age is the advent of suffering, which is necessary for temperment.
The ability to gently, humbly rebuke another and weather the storms of controversy and backlash comes only from this temperment.
It is trite, but true, that you can only have decades of experience after decades of life.

# Empty Hands


In truth, we all come empty handed before Yahweh.
One day, every knee will bow before Him and every tongue will confess who He is.
So many heroes of the faith pre-dated the law as if to expose the lack of our need for it.
Many more were gentle pagans who simply believed.
Even the great Israelite heroes were parodies against the backdrop of Yahweh's throne of grace.

**Lexical** understanding of how words, phrasing, and structure are utilized.

**Theological** content including what had been revealed at the time of writing and the purpose of the passage.

**Literary** inspection of the general style as well as inluded forms.

**Comparison** of synethetic works such as translations and commentaries.

**Application** for the original audience and for the ageless audience.[1Kgs 6:1]

  - doesn't align w/ the Bible's auto-interpretation (Paul, chronologies, etc.)
- Symbolic (1267BC)
  - times are rough or symbolic
  - 480 = 4 * 40 (40 being symbolic of a trial)

Factual Acquaintance


Reading the Bible "in context" should not mean: "quote the whole passage".
It means that we must understand:
  1) the Bible was not written to us.
  2) we ought to discover the lifestyle, customs, and beliefs that shaped the people that the Bible was written to.
  3) we need to uncover the theology (i.e. doctrine) of the day.

Those means becoming acquainted with people long-dead based on evidence of their lives.
Fear of the LORD


{Job 28:28}
	wisdom = fear of the Lord
	understanding = turn away from evil

{Ps 19:9}
	fear of the Lord is clean ~ its always appropriate, always right

{Ps 34:11}
	it can be passed on
	=
	1) don't speak evil
	2) flee from evil
	3) seek peace

{Is 11:2-3}
	the Spirit of...
		wisdom and understanding
		counsel and might
		Knowledge and FotL

{Acts 9:31}
	the Church being built up
	...walking in FotL
	...comfort of the Holy Spirit

Results in...
	Wisdom - {Ps 111:10} {Prov 9:10} {Prov 15:33}
	Knowledge - {Prov 1:7}
	Long Life - {Prov 10:27} {Prov 14:27} {Prov 19:23}
	Strong confidence - {Prov 14:26}
	Security - {Prov 15:16}
	Righteousness - {Prov 16:6}
	Riches {Prov 22:4}
	Honor {Prov 22:4}

Those who don't fear Him...
	don't receive an answer from Him {Prov 1:28-29}

Definition:
	{2Cor 5:10-11} - the knowledge that we will be judged
	{Prov 2:4-5} - comes from seeking Word, leads to knowledge of Him
	{Prov 8:13} - FotL = hatred of evil
	{Prov 9:10} - FotL = beginning of wisdom
	{Is 33:5-6} - Zion's treasure

# Generational Curses
...are a dangerous lie

[Jer 31:29+]()
- This passage explicitly states that Yahweh takes a personal view of salvation
- He does not attribute a prior generation's fault to this one

[Ex 20]()
- The decalogue gives high-level, personal view of Yahweh's interaction with us

### Do we suffer because of our parents or ancestors?
Yes, sometimes!
We may very well suffer because of another person's stupid choice(s).
However, our salvation is never [Biblically] dependent on another's actions.

### Imaging
"Taking the Lord's name" refers to bearing/carrying the image of God **on purpose**.
This is a personal decision and affects our life...other's indirectly (note the circular pointer back to ancestral affects.)
# God and gods


Bible students know that _elohim_ is used to refer to created beings as well as the Creator.
The term refers to a kind rather than a position.

The Church fathers believed that non-christian religions were demonic.
However, there are grains of truth in them because they often have roots in _elohim_.
# God Cannot

Do
1) Cannot lie
2) Cannot learn (amen, then He cannot be disappointed)
3) Cannot force you


Does not know:
1) a sin he doesn't hate
2) a sinner he doesn't love
3) a path to His throne other than Christ
4) a better time than now for adoption

The Bible is not a history book, but it does detail many historical events.
It is important to recognize the difference between ancient historical narrative and modern historical records.
Modern historical works tend to give a sequence of events with sporadic illucidation.
Ancient historical works tend to narrate a story with enough details to give you a context in time and space.

In many cases the primary goal of an ancient writing was not to make a historical record.
For example, the Bible is a theological book in which history is secondary.
This does not mean historical accuracy is lacking, but that it is woven in with enough important detail to verify the place and characters.

This does mean the narrative style is less valid than our modern style.
In fact, the modern style typically foregoes the story elements in favor of facts.
This means that recovering the humanity of events requires gleaning human nuggets from many historical records.

We should not haste to dismiss ancient historical accounts because they do not align with our methods of record.
Ancient authors were greatly constrained by publishing methods and expended great energy recording important events in a way that was terse and yet profound.# Holiness


The property of Yahweh which distinguishes Him from all others.

A communicable attribute of Yahweh.


## Etymology

qds ~ _qadesh_; hallowed, dedicated
'agios ~ _hagios_; saints, set-apart

Holy things are set apart, distinct from others.
i.e. "holy ones" are those set apart by Yahweh


## Application

Holy things are fundamentally holy, as are their materiel.
There is no distinction, in Yahweh's view, of sacred and secular in the holy life.

# What is a Human?
...I know one when I see one.


## Background

Humanity is not a physiological trait.
We know humans who are missing limbs or unable to speak that still have the spark of life.
However, we can say that humanity requires some embodiment.
Humans also have a psyche and a pneuma.
The three-part symbiote follows a pattern of creation.

Interestingly, the body is made up of separate systems; some of which might be classified as separate organisms.
For instance, the gut microbiome is a collective that operates distinctively and is implanted into the body.
Some argue that the blood is a distinct organelle: created and housed by the body.
Along the lines: it stands to reason that the mind and spirit are not simple, homogenous things either.
Rather, they are complex systems in their own rights.
e.g. the mind has an emotional system and a rational system.
e.g. the spirit embues consciousness and deep identity.


## Thesis

The armor, listed in Ephesians 6, is a template the human being.
We take the presumption that a human is three-fold: body, mind, and spirit.
The question becomes: what do the pieces of armor cover?

Helmet of Salvation: brain, mind, sight
Breastplate of Righteousness: heart, will, connection
Belt of Truth: loins, affections, intuition
Shoes of Evangel: movement, mobility, purpose
Shield of Faith: protection
Sword of the Spirit: power

I contend that the covered zones are what distinguish a human.
The shield and sword are tools, which makes them a different element and not alike with the armor in this case.

Interestingly, the human with God is more than the typical human.
This notion would be highly contrary if the offer were not freely available to all.

Nerdily enough, we get a tidy 4x4 matrix of the human being with God:

| Deity | Physical | Psyche | Spirit |
| === | === | === | === |
| Salvation | Brain | Mind | Sight |
| Righteousness | Heart | Will | Connection |
| Truth | Loins | Affections | Intuition |
| Evangel | Movement | Mobility | Purpose |
Hypocrisy
= dissociative dissemblance

### Purpose
[John 6:35] I am the bread of life
[John 8:12] I am the light of the world
[John 10:9] I am the door
[John 10:11] I am the Good Shepherd
[John 11:25] I am the resurrection and the life
[John 14'6] I am the way, the truth, and the life
[John 14:4] I am the vine



# Identity
...sameness, distinctiveness 
~ from identitatem- same meaning


## Same as What?

Metaphysically, our identity is a determination of ways we are distinct from and similar to others.
  e.g. human/not, male/female, efiminate/macho
There are many points of overlap with other creatures
...but also many distinctives: those things that make us individual.
The points of comparison may be physical, spiritual, mental.
"You're unique, just like everyone else."

However, our perception is exposed by our lack of sense.
i.e. "You're just a spoiled suburban girl who thinks she's being a rebel by doing what every other suburban girl does."

1Cor 15:3-10
especially "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain."
- This is the providential nature AND nurture of our development
- God can, and does, change our identity; i.e. we can be adopted into His family; i.e. formative life events

"I'm a natural-born leader/entertainer/etc." is nonsense.
It is a mistake to conflate behavioral and vocational aptitude with identity.
Charisma, timing, and speech are learned and, though they may be enhanced by beauty, vision, and natural ability.
Such things are what we do, not who we are.
Cultivating abilities are a way to reveal, or codify, our identity.

"I identify as a <gender>" is also a nonsense statement because we cannot change our identity.
We may grow into it; i.e. learn what it is and understand it better.
It is a revelation to us.


## Who Am I

We glean our identity four ways:
1. 3rd party ~ someone tells you
2. Experience ~ learning/study, events or teachers
4. Rumination ~ introspection, reflecting on the tapestry of truth made of the threads of life
3. Mystical ~ experiencing the interplay of nature and ability


There are 6 ways we intersect with others.
Thus, 6 ways our true identity is exposed in utility.
...hence, the 6 pieces of armor in [Eph 6]()
- truth ~ testimony; facts & striving to understand them
- righteousness ~ ethics & morality;  determining what is right and doing it
- salvation ~ destiny; the hope of were/are/will-be moving away from harm
- message ~ evangel; preparation for peace...beyond the  war-zone
- faith ~ belief; working with conviction
- spirit ~ capability; working with empowerment


## Components of Identity
...not a complete list

Humanity

Gender

Sinfulness

Belief/Unbelief

Guilt/Innocence


## What We Want vs Are

We often displace our perception of our actual self with what we desire to be.
Thus, discovering our identity necessarily requires us to dispose of error and ignorance.


## The Razor's Edge

Jacob/Israel epitomizes the identity crisis:
  when acting apart from God he is called Jacob
  when walking with God he is called Israel


# Exposition

What things expose our true identity?

How does identity, and our view of it, intertwine with character?  Put another way: what happens in us when we don't see our true identity?

# Inflimation

## Implication vs. Inference

To imply means that the giver intends a subjunctive or rhetorical meaning.

To infer is to draw out such meaning.
However, we fallibles so often impose or project meaning where the author gives none.

The difficulty here is that an meaning can be providentially woven into a text by the orchestration of the author's life.
This meaning can only be had by recognizing and shelving your own presuppositions.
There is additional meaning in combining, as scriptural, different texts which are cross-cultural and onter-temporal; i.e. the books of the Bible.


## Deduction vs. Induction

Deduction is gleaning truth from a source.

Induction is deriving truth via proposing and evaluating arguments that match a supposed truth.

Both of these are valid forms of study but depends heavily on the examiner objectivity.
In deducing, "am I in person of all the facts?"
In induction, "am I considering the nature of the source?"

Are the laws of nature (i.e. physical laws) correspondant with laws of spirituality?

Leadership at War


We are in a spiritual war.
This requires a much more serious attitude than most Western Christians carry.
There are several virtues which denote a leader who _will be_ successful.


Humility
---------
Humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less.


Excellence
----------
Excellence is doing the very best within the circumstances you find yourself.


Vision and Mission
-------------------
An end goal is essential, as are milestones.
Strategy and tactics only work if a vision and mission exist.


Courage
-------
Courage is doing what's right under fire.
There is no opportunity for courage if there is no opposition.
It takes no courage to do something the easy (unethical) way.Literal Interpretation

All have "gone astray" thus He bore "the inquity of us **all**"

11-12) Many
**many** will be accounted righteous
a portion with the **many**
He bore the sin of **many**

Can it be said that the remedy was meant for all but only accepted by a few?
Obviously, if there are some unsaved, there is something not applied to all - but just to the many?

# Melchizedek

[Gen 14]
    Malchi ~ King, also a Canaanite deity name
    Tsedek ~ Canaanite god
    ...also pre-canaanite kings of the realm, hypostases of Shamosh'
    [Heb 7:2] ~ King of Righteousness
    ...but the Hebrew is more flexible than that
    ...is it a personal name or title?
        theophoric ~ name containing a deity name (like Jeremiah)

    peric compogenus ~ vestige of a case system (may imply that Tsedek is not a suffix)
    ...but normative interpretation doesn't agree with this

    at the time of Joshua, Jerusalem was a Canaanite city
        MlkTsdk ~= King of Jerusalem?

    Salem, Shalem; Canaanite deities intertwined in this: 

[Ps 45:7-8]
    He will judge the world with _tsedek_
    He judges the peoples with _meshor_

[Ps 110]
    why is the Davidic messianic lineage connected with Malchitsedek

    [Num 24:16-18] ~ knowledge of the Most High...then an end-times prophecy

    the original kingship goes back to Malchitsedek, thus Jesus' lineage (biological & spiritual) goes back thus

The priesthood of Malchitsedek was the original ordained one, Aaron's priesthood was, at best: a concession, at worst: a punishment

Malchitsedek was the prototype for the human/priest/king figure: an emblem, paragon, and icon.

## Issues

The ancient Jews came to believe that Melchizedek was a divine being.

MLCHZDK was the chief representative of Yahweh...which naturally concatenates with the Prince language.

The angel of the LORD is not portrayed the same way as the assistants of Yahweh - the _chief princes_

Based on a unification with the angel who appeared to Joshua (same language) Michael is not Melchizedek; nor is Melchizedek one of the same kind.

Hebrews 7 does not require a divine Melchizedek.
- "without genealogy" refers to the lack of Levitical priestly qualification; but Levitical qualification is not penultimate

[Ps 110] ~ God arbitrarily decides to make David a priest

Melchizedek gets conformed to Jesus, not the other way around.
# Messianic Prophecies

  Scepter of Judah
  - [Gen 49:10]()
  - the right of Israel to self-governance
    - manifested as corporal punishment
  - taken away under Roman rule shortly after Jesus' birth
  - ...so, Jewish leadership thought the "scepter" to be broken
  - ...but the Messiah had come
  - [Ps 60:7](), [Ps 108:8]()
    - Judah **is** the scepter

Date Setting
  - [Dan 9]()
    - given by Gabriel, who is always messaging Messianic stuff
    - ...the time matches multiple ways
      1. 1335 days until Alexander crossed the Dardanelles
      2. 483yr until the crucifixion: from 458BC ~ 25BC 
    - why date-setting is stupid:
      - not all "years" are the same
        - 46BC was 445 days long...by Imperial decree
        - the Essenes desired a 364 day year
        - the lunar calendar is 360 days
        - ours is 365.25
      - not to mention the great difficulty in pinpointing dates
        - 586BC demolition of Jerusalem is know from astronomical data
        - 3BC death of Herod is known from coinage studies

	Cherubim flanking the ark
	"Mixtures belong to the divine realm"
	Interbreeding violates God's distinctive modeling
	The curtain, walls, and garments in the Tabernacle were mixtures - and the belt of the priest; the civilian has a thread of blue in their white tassels.
	The greater the mixture ratio, the closer to the holiness

Most Good

[Num 18:9-10]
	The terminology "most holy" is used to describe sacrifices which were to nourish the priest(s).
	This corresponds roughly to the "very good" day of creation which is when man began to participate with God in work.
	-> sacrifices made to Yehovah were, preemptively, given to the priesthood for their nourishment.
	-> these were to be eaten in a holy place; as indwelt believers we are the holy place...

In [Mal 1:14] the LORD gives a characteristic of His name: it is dreadful - antithetically inspiring.
Likewise, [Is 52:5] has God expositing the hatred of His name.
# Name Theology


Yahweh is referred to _as_ His name.
The name is applied to His followers..

A common sticking point for readers in understanding Name Theology is
- that the biblical narrative appears to have a single author
- however, the text was obviously written and edited by multiple people

The answer to this is that Yahweh purposely includes humans in the process of creating and transmitting Scripture and superintends the entire process.

The needful determination is the nature of The Name.
Is it...
- Hypostasis?
- Literacy?
- 

The substance of JEDP is the evolution of thought about Yahweh.
In conjunction with Name Theology this is relevant: humanity is more and more cognizant of the unchanging truth.

Attributes of the Name:
- it is owned
- is placed


Narrative Hyperbole in Biblical Mathematics


An analysis of numbers in the Bible reveals a theological encoding in dates, timespans, and ordinality.
Using modern, forensic techniques we can determine whether certain numbers are artificial or actual accountings.
Artificial numbers do not undermine the authority and infallibility of Scripture.
On the contrary, when the Bible is thus shown to be congruent with known patterns of thought in the ancient mind and superior in message it is all the more amazing.

# Obeying Revelation

[Rev 1:3]
Blessed are those who:
- read aloud
- hear
- keep what is written in it

What does keep mean?
_tyrantes_ is often translated keep, or observe
[Matt 28:4] it is translated as **fear**# Ontology

...a set of concepts and categories that shows the properties of a thing and the relations to others

The Peter Principle


Author Lawrence Peter created _The Peter Principle_, which states: "Every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."
Two corollaries fill out this principle:
  (1) In time, every post tends to be occupied by someone who is incompetent to carry out his duties, and
  (2) work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.

There are several unhealthy, unprincipled coping mechanisms employed by the incompetent:
  Scapegoating
  ...casting blame onto another

  False-foci
  ...redirecting attention where it should not be; i.e. onto a subordinate or an unworthy leader

  Unhumility
  ...a brand of falseness where pretend grace and mercy are given for selfish ends.


Biblically:
  There is a limit to our abilities

  [2COR 3:5]  Our sufficiency is from God (i.e. adequacy, enablement)

  [1KGS 22]  People don't want to hear what they don't want to hear.

  One who is gifted to pastor is not, necessarily, also a teacher, preacher, or administrator.
Omnicompetence is a myth.
Pastors are, unrightly, expected to be expert in commendation (interpersonal skills), emendation (corrective leadership), and proclamation (preaching).

# Practical Theology

```
"If the Church was doing its job, we wouldn't need seminaries."
J.Anderson
```
Like it or not, this sentiment does express a Biblical concept of theological fulfillment.
Paul expresses that his letter are to be read aloud and dissemenated. [Col 4:16]
John expresses that the Holy Spirit teaches us through communion and convocation (group activities.) [1Jon 2:27]

More importantly, though, this paradigm seeks to reunite the theoretical with the actual.
Put another way: we ought to be developing the theology of all believers, no matter their starting point, because that is a necessary part of God's work.


## Practicality

If we assume that our current state is both important and deliberate (ramifications of God's love and sovreignty) then this state has meaning.
This meaning can be derived continuously formulating a personal theology.

One form of feedback that informs and grows our theology is the circumstantial world around us.
There is the empirical task of just observing and describing things.
There is the interpretive task of discerning the cause of things.
There is the intuitive task of optimizing things.
There is the assessment task of gauging and implementing a response.

Put another way (per Richard Osmer):
1. What is going on?
2. Why is this going on?
3. What ought to be going on?
4. How might we respond?

# Principle


## Material Principle
= theological system


## Formal Principle
= source of a belief
# Prooftexting
...the act of proving a supposition or argument based on individual verses or passages of Scripture.

## The Old Method

This may be a touchy subject because purveyors of this method are, notably, trying to establish truth based on the Biblical text.
However, it is a faulty process to _prove_ an idea based on anything less than the whole of Scripture.
The notion that we simply aggregate a list of all verses which apply to a certain idea and comment on them is seriously flawed.

Here are some specific downfalls to this method:
- versification is not inspired, it is very late and was simply scribal input
- narrow lexical context is inherently dubious
- meta-information is lost in truncated quotations

### Versification

### Context

### Meta-Info


## The New Method

Instead of attempting to plow under the idea of prooftexting we should find a new paradigm where it makes sense and achieves the desired end: preaching the truth.


In this context "prove" means to test and strain and idea the same way the metals are melted and the slag removed.

When proving an idea it is necessary to
1st - glean the associated Biblical principles;
2nd - collect passages which are related
3rd - understand the historical context of the passages' occurrence
	- note that the authorship, the actual writing down of the passage as we have it, probably never conincides with the event
4th - understand the literary context of the passages
	- what genre are they?
	- who is the intended audience?
	- who is the story about?
	- what is it's placement in the story of Christ?

Armed with this background research it is possible to then begin to reason about any issue in light of Scripture.
Why did God create Adam? us?

to function as He designed us

image-bearers ~= representatives

decreed to create
    art + usefulness
    modeled after Yahweh

    we are the work of Yahweh's hands
    the work of our hands' is our output
    ...does it cause us the worship the Creator? or the thing? or ourselves?

	God is restraining Satan

[Is 59:19]
Salt


In ancient times salt was:
- a preservative
- a condiment 
- very precious

The salt they used was not pure salt as we have today but, often, diluted by other minerals (or dirt).


## Lifeblood

Meat with blood in it was forbidden to Israelites because of the life-taking connection.
Meat "treated" or rendered with salt was good to eat...barring cookery.

Interesting parallel with the Church:
	The world = [Mic 3:1-3]
	Believers = [Matt 5:13]


## Preservative

perhaps the greatest service we do for the world is as vessels for the Holy Spirit; when we are absent the situation always degrades

	


## Flavoring

[Lev 2:13]() 
- salt on every grain offering

# Septuagint
~ the Greek translation of old testament scriptures


This was the most prevalent canon of scripture by Jesus' time.

The name refers to the tradition of there being 70 scholars who worked on it.
it may have actually been 72, six from each tribe of Israel (according to Philo.)

It is referenced by the acronym LXX.

It contained 46 books: the 22 of the Tanakh (divided like modern Bibles) plus other books.
It contains deuterocanonical books: ...
It contains extra hagiographical books: ...

The translation began in 300BC and completed in 132 BC.

# Sophistry
...in the scholarly realm: the act of using fallacious arguments to induce non-existent arguments on material

e.g.
	[2Pet 2:4]
	[Jude 6]
# Soul Sleep

The idea of soul-sleep was absent in the ancient near-east.

The common belief of the Hebrews was encapsulated in being "gather to their fathers".
i.e. burying people with belonging implies the belief that they thought the afterlife was a physical existence.

[Is 14:9] ~ conscience interaction of dead people

Further, contact with the dead was forbidden - why if the dead are "asleep"?
...and, spirits don't die (only humans do).
# Spiritual Topology

Topology is a study of the shape of a space.

Navigating a space requires a coordinate system, made up of dimensioanl axes.
The shape of a space is governed by the relationship between axes.

Necessarily, spiritual topology is a space whose axes are indivisible doctrinal ideas.
Position in an ideal equates to position in a dimension.
Interrelations between doctrines governs the shape of the overall space, which is the theology.


There are some interesting spatial notions in Scripture.
It is important to note that these rarely include time or cardinality.
Often, timelines and hierarchies are induced rather than deduced when it comes to Biblical thought.


## [Ps 103]
The driving idea in this song is the desire to convey gratitude to Yahweh:
- as Majesty
- as Giver
- as Healer
- as Redeemer
- as Satisfier

So, while this work does not contradict natural law it is not intended to convery scientific meaning, but spiritual.

11) "as high as the heavens are above the earth"

Ancient man thought that the heavens were a shell covering the disc of the earth.
We now know that the heavens are much further away.
This is a long distance but not interminable.
With this in mind our current knowledge shows Yahweh's love to be greater than ever imagined.
Note the caveat: "toward those who fear him"

12) "as far as the east is from the west"

Again, ancient thought perceived this distance to be finite; large, perhaps unknowable to us, but finite.
We now know that this distance is, in fact, infinite.
You can travel east forever; hence, the reason scholars often eschew categoricals involving "east" and "west".

17) "from everlasting to everlasting"

An important mathematical note about the foreverness of Yahweh.
Recall that when Moses was present His message it's origin was named, "I Am that I Am".
A pedantic, though correct, interpretation would simply be that Yahweh occupies all things.

19) "His throne in the heavens"

An interesting side-note to re-invigorate the idea that God has physicality and is interested in physical/temporal things.


## [Col 1]

17) "He is before all things"

Again we have a mathematical exposition.
This gets to the heart of the matter: God must be the origin or all else fails.

The personhood of Yahweh even predates knowledge and wisdom [Prov 8:22].

17) "in Him all things hold together"

Here we begin to see the incorporation of dimensionality.
There are many disparate ideas and ideals which are only conjoined in a theology.
This passage is about the preemminence of God in relation to all other powers;
However, we mustn't fail to see that the language does not discount _all else_.
vv.15-16 systematically broaden the scope of God's power from personhood to **all**.

The aim of this enterprise of incarnation and dominance is not arbitrary: it is reconciliation.
For the purposes of the current topic, suffice it to say that the union of the ideals is that Yahweh is the framework of the topology.

Refugees from the purges settled in Egypt and Arabia. From widely scattered surviving fragments, it is possible to reconstruct the world view of the first Christians, and to restore to their original setting such key concepts as the Messiah, divine Sonship, covenant, atonement, resurrection, incarnation, the Second Coming and the Kingdom of God.
 	 
METHODS USED

Temple Theology draws on all available resources:  
Hebrew and Greek Scriptures
New Testament
Jewish and Christian Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha
Dead Sea Scrolls
Other Ancient Near Eastern texts
Gnostic texts
Rabbinic and later Jewish writings and traditions
Early Christian writings and liturgies
Memories that survive in art and architecture 
A complex and sophisticated theology is beginning to re-emerge from the symbols and stories of a pre-philosophical culture	 	
IMPLICATIONS

Temple theology reviews and rethinks. It suggests:

That the current Old Testament is neither the text nor the ‘canon’ that was known and used by the first Christians. 
That the non-canonical writings were preserved by Christians and excluded by Jews because they marked important differences between them. 
That Sola Scriptura has hindered rather than helped the understanding of Christianity.
That Christianity was heir to the Temple tradition and so was by no means a ‘new’ religion in the first century.
 	 	 
ELEMENTS
Temple theology is based on the ideas that: 

The Temple/Tabernacle was a microcosm of the creation
Day One was the Holy of Holies, the Unity beyond time and matter, the world of the angels and the Kingdom of God.
The eternal covenant held visible and invisible creation in one system.
The fallen angels taught mortals how to abuse knowledge and thus break the bonds of the covenant.
The liturgies maintained the creation
Atonement was the ritual self offering of the Lord to renew the eternal covenant  and thus heal the creation. This was the covenant renewed at the Last Supper
Priests were angels and angels were priests
The Lord, the God of Israel, was the Son of God Most High, the Second God
Jesus was recognised as the Lord in this sense.
The royal High Priest was the Lord with his people
Incarnation was symbolised by the vestments
The Queen of Heaven, also known as Wisdom, had been part of the original Temple cult as Virgin Mother of the Messiah. 
Humans could become angels. This was known as resurrection or theosis. 
The Temple was remembered as Eden.
Adam was the original high priest, and leaving Eden was losing the Temple.
The New Testament reverses the story of Eden and brings Christians back to the original Temple.
Pythagoras knew this system of thought and it appears in Plato’s Timaeus.

The Holy Stapler


Gen 14:4 = When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.


But...the territory of Dan didn't exist in Abraham's time, that city/area was know a Laish.
So, it's apparent that this passage was edited later.
This doesn't necessarily undermine Mosaic authorship, just identifies that the Biblical text has been edited/stewarded through the ages.

Another notable example is Ezekiel 1 where we have both 1st and 3rd person references.

In fact, this continues throughout Church history.
The Septuagint originally had 46 books - whereas the Hebrew Tanakh had 22.

The original Catholic Bible had ?78? (latin).

We have 3 different traditions of Hebrew manuscripts for our Canon all in close agreement and dating from Jesus' time.
We have several complete copies of the new testament scriptures from 2nd and 3rd century sources which agree closely.

This term 'close agreement' has no negative impact on essential doctrines (or even (my opinion) secondary doctrines).
In fact, this transmission of Scripture through time is even more amazing when we see the hand of man involved and the precise quality of the Word which is delivered to us.
# The Law of Christ

[Gal 6:2]
[1Cor 9:21]

law as in [Acts 19:39]


# The Threshing Floor


[Judg 6]()
	Gideon lays out the fleece...on a threshing floor


[Deut 15:14]() [Joel 2:24]()
	Threshing floors = food production


[1Sam 23:1-3]
	David fought to save the threshing floor


The Threshing Floor
	[2Sam 24:16-18]() [1Chr 21:28]()
		God met David there
		The prophet instructed an altar to be built there
		God accepted the sacrifices via fire

	[1Chr 22:1]
		David purposed to build the temple there


Ramoth-Gilead
	gods were expected to come to threshing floors (counterfeits)
	[1Kgs 22:19-23]()
		prophets presumed God would be heard at threshing floors


Bottom Line
	God meets us where we are
	His presence can sanctify any ground, He chooses ground important to _us_
	Yahweh's threshing floor appearance made it sacred space
# The Tithe

The tithe is, literally, "the tenth".
Our vernacular has it as the sum of our giving.
The modern, western, christian standard of giving is 10% of the gross income.
Most give less than this, some give more.
Biblical giving was 22.5%, by law, because they gave a tenth twice plus other offerings.
We see in the Bible giving rates as high as 100% (the widow and her mites (whom Jesus publically honored)).

Unspoilt, Sophsticated Astralification


We began our existence in an unspoilt state.
God disallowed our presence in the garden for our fallen state.
The Law gave credence to Yahweh's plan and codified guilt.
Believers will one day be "as the stars".

---

We began our existence in an unspoilt condition.
God always held together the created fabric of each being, but His doing so was never in doubt.
Our faithfulness, however, was dubious.

After the fall humanity developed civilizations and patriarchal, cultic societies.
God did not immediately condescend to show us the perfect way to conduct human culture.
Rather, He taught us - via the law - the utter depravity and need of man.
He did this teaching in the context of the ancient near eastern society.

The ultimate goal of Yahweh is His own glorification.
We have a seat at the divine council awaiting us.
The language of star-stuff is used for the future of the elect.

What God Doesn't Know

...a sin He doesn't hate

...what it means to labor in vain
Originally the solae were declared as three:
- scripture over tradition
- faith over works
- grace over merit
# Sola Fide
"solely faith"


Three Elements:
- God gives faith
- We do not merit this faith
- The must be loyalty


Faith does not do anything, it allows reception of His gifts.
We then have the status of Yahweh's child: the favouritism and resources.
Sola Gratia
"soley grace"
Sola Scriptura
"solely scripture"
Soli Dei Gloria
"soley God's glory"

Bach signed his compositions "sdg" in reference to this.
Solus Christus
"soley Christ"

## Conservation of Information

Verbs & Nouns

Increasing constraints increases information.
Removing/reducing probability increases information (entropy).
...as opposed to matter which is aggregated to build things.

e.g. if you were looking for a hidden object and I gave you more and more hints on where to find it I am giving you information
...the probability of an object's location meeting those criteria decreases.


## Origins

Information must:
- Initialize (default values)
- Instantiate (incorporate into a useful form)

### Teliology
...the study of origins

Everything must have an origin.
The lower the probability, i.e. the more information, the more detailed the original program.


### Indogeneity
...indogenous information is unique, indogeneity refers to the "uniqueness" of a thing

I love my wife.  I love her more than myself.  That has not always been the case.  Whether good or ill: I take much responsibility for her insecurity and pride because of my leadership in our home.  However, knowing her deficiencies I do not expect to see her in heaven: for she will be so close to the throne that Christ's blinding glory will wash away all view of her.
I know my wife is not perfect but I have seen Christ in her: when she suffered through my emotional affair with another woman, when she willingly served people who were bad to her just to be a martyr; as she has been unfailingly loyal to all of us family & friends who do not deserve it.  It is this cherishing love for her, which Yahweh has given me, that is meant to be a picture of the Church.  As I love my wife (which, honestly isn't enough) so Christ loves the Church and gave Hisself for it infinitely more.

These living allegories are dim reflections of the truth.
But we are imagers nonetheless; both in being and doing.
And if there are, as I suspect, as many instantiations of spiritual gifts asBelievers -
then there are at least as many implementations of incorporating believers.
But there are right and wrong ways for us to organize.
There are good and bad practices.
This is what I wish to explore herein.

At first, the word "incorporating" stings a bit.
I am diametrically opposed to the modern church-as-business model of congregating.
I believe it nothing less than high-handed authoritarian religion in modern garb.
Aren't we loyal believers the temple of Yahweh regardless of time or place.
We are simultaneously the living stones of the holy priesthood that make it up.
And we are committed members from the moment of our spiritual birth

Before we dive into anything deeply I feel it necessary to say two things (the fact that I am limited and prideful goes without saying):
1) Nothing I say or write is original...I am just a researcher.
2) You should be Berean: search the Scriptures daily to find out if these things are so...

Normal Glory
...the prevalence of relevance thinking and the evaporation of orthodoxy in the institutionalized Church...


Orthodoxy is a lighthouse, not a wall.

What is normative in the Church (sacrificial giving, true reconciliation of people with their creator and each other, spiritual intimacy) is not normal in common society - and this is, likewise, true in the institutionalized Church.
The Institution is any and all incorporated congregations of believers whose culture and worship is predominantly extra-Biblical.
Examples of common extra-Biblical pursuits are real-estate, idolatrous prayer, foundational extra-biblical studies, and worshipless fellowship and meals.
This boils down to a lack of orthodoxy (nominal beliefs) and orthopraxy (nominal practices).
The result is malnourishment: physical, emotional, and spiritual.

Centuries of high church and culturally driven orthopraxy have divorced Church members from their reality as sojourning citizens of a heaven.
We are, essentially, diplomats who require meetings together to maintain our health and sanity.
Furthermore the Institution propagates the divide between clergy and laity.
Such a divide is not Godly.
Yahweh rebukes priests who abuse their station: think of Aaron's sons or Elli's.

We have operated under the faulty notion that the Institution is necessary and remediable.
It is a circular rut that the Institution implements vicarious ministries which are only operable by a clergy (implying that there are _called_ among the "called").
Also, the spiritual gifts are not fully realizable or performant in the Institution:
Not all members will/can serve;
Gifts are feckless in a corporate faculty.
Not to mention that Institutional leadership structure is synthetic - not natural.
[Ps 115:8] those who make it [the institution​] become like it.

There are four dogmatic Church orthopraxy: apostolic teaching, fellowship, commensality, and prayer [Acts 2:42]
These are at best artificial in and, sadly, often absent from the Institution.
It is a travesty that institutionalised Christians miss out on the truest forms of these practices.

The hope in this research is to explore and exposit the issues involved in a mass believers' defection from the Institution.
Much of this research I need for myself and my family.
However, I've been personally confronted with multiple families and individuals who are greatly disillusioned with the Institution.
But this is a great point of hope, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer states: disillusionment with man's estate reminds us of our reality in Jesus Christ.

Bottom line: the Church is not a place or time.
It is a demographic.
When there is no longer good Bible study, and biblical worship, and Christlike shepherding then you are left with a social club.
The purely social congregation cannot help but lapse into moralism - it has nothing left but the desire to be like the thing it is not: the Church.
Forget that the Institution can flourish under good leadership.
This is not the mark of the Church nor it's mission.
Didache


- Biblical teaching is often absent from congregations
- Educated teachers are trained to protect "laity" from difficult Scriptures
Koinonia


The fellowship of an assembly.
A gathering of people's who believe in Jesus Christ is no idle thing.
There is no predisposition to corporate machinations as with synthetic religion.

Beyond the prescriptions of [Acts 2:42] there are commandments to:
- baptize
- eat the Lord's supper
- teach Scripture

It is natural for people to gather:
- near their home
- with people they know and like
- at a regular time

...but none of these things are mandatory nor prescribed **anywhere**.
# Commensality
...formal meal time

Meals should be eaten together.
Meals should be taken as a form of worship.
Proximity

It should be obvious that prayer is essential to the Christians life, but this is not the case.
# Miqdash
= a sacred space

Ultimately the Church is the sacred space.
However, the Church is a demographic - not a time or place.
So, the definition is necessarily bifurcated.

[1Cor 3:16]
  "you are God's template" is this personal or corporate?  It's both...but note that the individual is not a brick in a wall, he is the whole thing.
  "dwells in you" implies that worship, sacrifice, and conversation occur within the believer **and** the Church.
