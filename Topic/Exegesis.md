# Exegesis

## What is it

Exegesis is gleaning from, rather than reading into, scripture

- gospel story
- human story
- sin
- decrees
- commands
- promises
  - unconditional
  - conditional
- principles
- themes


## Fallacies

### Foreign Root

The meaning of a root word does not impute meaning to the derived word.
The current context is ultimate.


### Shared Roots

timao, epitimao
honor, rebuke


### Etymological

anagnosko = to read
	ana = up
	gnosko = know

epitimao = rebuke
	epi = upon
	timao = honor

butterfly = an insect

headship


### Sound

wine / whine

yam ~ hebrew = body of water; english = vegetable

bow ~ hebrew = to arrive; english = weapon


## Process

**Summarize** and notate interesting tidbits.

**Historical-Cultural** considerations of the author(s), original audience, editor(s), etc.

**Contextual** analysis of surrounding passages, contemporary passages, and similar works.

**Lexical** understanding of how words, phrasing, and structure are utilized.

**Theological** content including what had been revealed at the time of writing and the purpose of the passage.

**Literary** inspection of the general style as well as inluded forms.

**Comparison** of synethetic works such as translations and commentaries.

**Application** for the original audience and for the ageless audience.
