# Sola Fide
"solely faith"


Three Elements:
- God gives faith
- We do not merit this faith
- The must be loyalty


Faith does not do anything, it allows reception of His gifts.
We then have the status of Yahweh's child: the favouritism and resources.

Habakkuk 2:4
Hebrews 11:1


## Pathology 

* If faith isn't necessary then it is but salvation but compliance
* If faith is the full means then it becomes works salvation
