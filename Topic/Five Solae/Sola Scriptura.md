Sola Scriptura
"solely scripture"


Elevating human wisdom, signs, or dreams in a place of authority dilutes the authority of Scripture.

Every such thing must be edified and filtered by Scripture.
Some filters will eradicate these, some will elevate them;
But none will surpass Scripture without undermining Christian belief.
