Sola Scriptura
"solely scripture"

2 Timothy 3:16


Elevating human wisdom, signs, or dreams to a place of authority dilutes the authority of Scripture.
Every such thing must be edified and filtered by Scripture.
Some filters will eradicate these, some will elevate them;
But none will surpass Scripture without undermining Christian belief.  

Those scriptures which have been canonized are considered sacred and inspired. 
Sacred meaning it is devoted to the particular purpose of spiritual revelation and development. 
Inspired meaning it is a product of providential occasion. 
Inspiration is, in mainline scriptural interpretation, the collaborative product of God and man. 
We say that scriptural inspiration is _verbal plenary_ meaning its origin was speech and it's creation required all parties involved to be present: God and man.  

Sola Scriptura is not only about one book above all others but having a concrete basis for all theology (both erudite and mundane.)
Human derived wisdom is fallible and fungible.
What we need is the _theopneustos_: the breath of God is not just about primacy but penetration.
Divine words have a profound effect on humans at all levels, body, mind, and spirit, and all at once.
