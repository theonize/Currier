Soli Dei Gloria
"soley for God's glory"

Bach signed his compositions "sdg" in reference to this.

The only reason for our salvation, in fact the entire enterprise of redemption through all space and time, is for God's glory.

The dichotomy (without such we cannot possibly have a solae) is that we share in God's glory
In fact, the mode of salvation necessitates us being in His presence which allows for the personal connection.
It is His glory and we are His testimony and the joy is both of ours.
