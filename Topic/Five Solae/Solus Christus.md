# Solus Christus ~ Christ Alone
"soley Christ"

1. Christ is the sole avenue to redemption, no other path is sufficient. 
2. There really is only one Christ, Jesus of the Bible.

The Blind Men and the Elephant
- the elephant exists and is the whole truth
- the blind should endeavor to "see" the whole picture by examining different parts


The truth is not a library but a person.
Christ is the way, truth, and life 
The living revelation must have primacy beyond the knowledge and wisdom.

Some will accept the saving power of Jesus Christ but reject His uniqueness for salvation.
A key to Biblical theology is that there is only one true God and only His prescription is sufficient.
