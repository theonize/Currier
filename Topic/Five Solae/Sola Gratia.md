# Sola Gratia
"soley grace"

Grace is unmerited favor.
Salvation is gracious because we did not, cannot, earn it and yet He provides it anyway. 

The redemption of God is doubly gracious because it is unearned and it is beyond what is necessary. 
The grace of God was given in light of human sin, with foreknowledge of coming rebellion and fallbacks- even by those who would accept this salvation.
