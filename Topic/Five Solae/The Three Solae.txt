# Some Context

Originally the solae were declared as three:
- scripture over tradition
- faith over works
- grace over merit

While these do registrations the gospel it was decided that christology and hagiology should be bright to the forefront.
Also, comparing dogma with their twisted forms tends to equate them in the mind of the reader. 
Discussion of tradition, works, and merit are [at best] inconsequential and are [ad norma] a derailment of the gospel's core.

So, we have landed on these:
1. Sola Scriptura 
2. Sola Fide
3. Sola Gratia
4. Solus Christus
5. Soli Deo Gloria

There is no prescribed order, different authors and traditions give them in different order.
That order makes some since from the perspective that it mirrors what ease we receive in coming to experience salvation. 
However, in reality, we experience multiple aspects of salvation simultaneously and at different levels.
