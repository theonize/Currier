# Some Context

Originally the solae were declared as three:
- scripture over tradition
- faith over works
- grace over merit

While these do represent the gospel it was decided that:
- it us necessary to highlight the positive without the contrast
- christology and hagiology should be brought forward, rather than being a subtext to the others

Comparing dogma with their twisted forms tends to equate their weight in the mind of the reader. 
Discussion of tradition, works, and merit are [at best] inconsequential and are [ad norma] a derailment of the cute gospel message.

So, we have landed on these:
1. Sola Scriptura 
2. Sola Fide
3. Sola Gratia
4. Solus Christus
5. Soli Deo Gloria


## Ordo Solae

There is no prescribed order, different authors and traditions give them in different order.
That order makes some since from the perspective that it mirrors what ease we receive in coming to experience salvation. 
However, in reality, we experience multiple aspects of salvation simultaneously and at different levels. 


## Hermeneutic

The hard part of taxing the Solae is not Scripture, faith, Grace, Christ, or glory. 
The hard part is "solely by".
Harder still is five "sole" beliefs.
It is not an implication of a panchotomy- it is a recognition that we need each one without any addition or modification. 

Bob Stein offered the analogy of the hypodermic needle (which I have extrapolated from): 
- Faith is the needle
- Grace is the medicine
- Christ illuminates our disease
- Scriptures maps the cure
- Glory to God is the purpose for the healing
