Sola Scriptura
Pages speak truth’s light,
Ancient words alive and sure—
Our firm, guiding flame.

Sola Fide
Faith alone shall trust,
Not by works but belief’s rest—
Hope beyond our sight.

Sola Gratia
Grace flows unrestrained,
A gift neither earned nor sought—
Mercy’s gentle hand.

Solus Christus
Christ, the cornerstone,
No other name can redeem—
Path to life through Him.

Soli Deo Gloria
Glory to God raised,
Creation’s song lifts Him high—
All praise evermore.
