# Cryptography


Cryptography is a means of disguising a message so that only certain people can understand it.
An author wants to be understood by his audience.
The Bible has a plain message as intended by the authors- the human and the divine.
The Holy Spirit is the co-author of the Bible.
Thus, the human intended a certain meaning but the Holy Spirit embeds a deeper meaning.
In either case the meaning is meant to be understood.
Many meanings are embedded, some are only understandable by certain peoples.
