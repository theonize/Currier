# What is a Human?
...I know one when I see one.


## Background

Humanity is not a physiological trait.
We know humans who are missing limbs or unable to speak that still have the spark of life.
However, we can say that humanity requires some embodiment.
Humans also have a psyche and a pneuma.
The three-part symbiote follows a pattern of creation.

Interestingly, the body is made up of separate systems; some of which might be classified as separate organisms.
For instance, the gut microbiome is a collective that operates distinctively and is implanted into the body.
Some argue that the blood is a distinct organelle: created and housed by the body.
Along the lines: it stands to reason that the mind and spirit are not simple, homogenous things either.
Rather, they are complex systems in their own rights.
e.g. the mind has an emotional system and a rational system.
e.g. the spirit embues consciousness and deep identity.


## Thesis

The armor, listed in Ephesians 6, is a template the human being.
We take the presumption that a human is three-fold: body, mind, and spirit.
The question becomes: what do the pieces of armor cover?

Helmet of Salvation: brain, mind, sight
Breastplate of Righteousness: heart, will, connection
Belt of Truth: loins, affections, intuition
Shoes of Evangel: movement, mobility, purpose
Shield of Faith: protection
Sword of the Spirit: power

I contend that the covered zones are what distinguish a human.
The shield and sword are tools, which makes them a different element and not alike with the armor in this case.

Interestingly, the human with God is more than the typical human.
This notion would be highly contrary if the offer were not freely available to all.

Nerdily enough, we get a tidy 4x4 matrix of the human being with God:

| Deity | Physical | Psyche | Spirit |
| === | === | === | === |
| Salvation | Brain | Mind | Sight |
| Righteousness | Heart | Will | Connection |
| Truth | Loins | Affections | Intuition |
| Evangel | Movement | Mobility | Purpose |
