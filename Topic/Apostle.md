# Apostle

The apostle is a messenger who's commission is intended to be a stand-in for the sender.

Etymologically the word is derived from "apo" and "stle" which are indicative of an authority and a style (as in "stylus").
The indication is, as above, a representative of the regulator (or law-giver.)

Consider also the term "epistle" whose etymology is similar- "epi" and "stle" can be taken as "super" and "stylus" meaning a writing of the first-order.
This is how the term is used to describe biblical teaching correspondences.
