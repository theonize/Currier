# Hermeneutics

Hermeneutics is the art of crafting a sermon.

In order to bring a passage to life for the purpose of preaching or teaching you must examine it, as a whole, in several lights:
1. When was it written? by whom?
2. What time/people/place was it written about?
3. To whom was it written?
4. What are it's literary characteristics?
5. What is it's lexical structure?
6. What are it's theological elements?

It behooves you to bring in a few ancillary passages that augment these facets...no more than 1 per section.
Story and alliteration are also useful to flesh out ideas and concepts.
