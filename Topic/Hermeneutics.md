# Hermeneutics

Hermeneutics is the art of crafting a sermon.

In order to bring a passage to life for the purpose of preaching or teaching you must examine it, as a whole, in several lights:
1. When was it written? by whom?
2. What time/people/place was it written about?
3. To whom was it written?
4. What are it's literary characteristics?
5. What is it's lexical structure?
6. What are it's theological elements?

It behooves you to bring in a few ancillary passages that augment these facets...no more than 1 per section.
Story and alliteration are also useful to flesh out ideas and concepts.

Hermeneutics


!!! we must interpret all Scripture via the same principles
	e.g. do not interpret prophetic passages one way and decretive passages another way

Tools
	Etymology ~ etymonline.org
	Hitchcock's Book of Names
	Biblical Mathematics
	Concordance

examples
	Noah's genealogy
	Isaiah 37
	Daniel 10 (horns, Antioches Epiphanes)
	?Paul's conversion and later testimony (Acts 9 & 26)
	John 1:1


[Rev 19:10] - it must point to Christ


Level of Interpretation (explain each term, then present the passages)
	Literal
		[Rev 7:1], [Josh 10:12-14], [Rev 18:9-13]
		historical
		figures of speech (simile/metaphor)
		prophetic

	Application
		[2Chr 11:13-15]
		'Israel' ~ chosen of God

	Mystical
		e.g. Ark ~ delivery vessel (of His testimony)
			[Gen 6] - delivering His people (and supporting cast)
			[Ex 25:10,21] - "an ark", a model of the Ark
			[Rev 11:19] - "the ark", the original
		patterns
			remez = hint
			meta-exposition
				water, wine, blood
				"prophecy is pattern"
				names
			symbology (plants, animals, woods, metals)
			unfinished lists
			numbers, syllabic meanings, meta-data (tread lightly)
			ELSs (tread lightlier)

	Allegorical
		-[Rev 1:12-20]
		[Rev 4]
		{four living creatures}
		allusion
			allegory = description of one thing under the image of another
			?Vs.?

Da Rulz
	The Golden Rule
		= WHEN THE PLAIN SENSE OF SCRIPTURE MAKES COMMON SENSE; MAKE NO OTHER SENSE.
			traditionalists say SEEK no other sense, there is not harm in seeking as long as we
				A) honor the Word
				B) take the plain meaning as primary
		primary ~= literal ~= ordinary
			'secondary' importance is implied for other levels of interpretation
			the Bible is a plain book for common mortals
		rationalism
	Symbolism
		hidden meanings are always exposited elsewhere in the Scripture
			searching is always rewarding
			prospect, don't speculate
				In mining prospecting means digging where you are, speculating means getting new plots to dig in.
	Multiple Reference
		a Scriptural passage may blend disconnected events/people
		Rev 2-3 ~ the churches, church ages, and personal phases
		[Is 14:4,12-17]
			King of Babylon && Lucifer
			[Rev 12:4,9]
		[Is 11:1-5]
			branch = רצנ
			Nazareth = Ναζαρα
	Recurrence
		important ideas are scattered throughout (spread spectrum :)
		multiple passages detailing a single event
		Gen 1:1-2:3, 2:4-25
		Ezk 38:1-23, 39:1-16
		Rev 6-16, 17|18
		NOT?
			[Matt 24:3] [Mark 13:3]
			[Luke 21:5]
	Context
		~ a text apart from it's context is a pretext
		context = preceding and/or following text
		pretext = text(s) imported for an ostensible reason
		beware the eisigesis
		you _cannot_ prove anything by the Bible
		[Zech 13:6]
			the greater passage speaks of false teachers!
	Expositional Constancy
		= idioms and ideals are consistent throughout
		the Holy Spirit will use the same idioms over and over via different authors and different forms of speech
		the number of recurrances of an idea is important
		e.g. Acacia
			"thorn bush of the desert"
			crown of thorns
			material of Ark
				covered w/ gold (glory)
			burning bush (likely)
				fire = judgment
		e.g. Wine
		e.g. Shoes
			don't wear out in desert
			Boaz [Ruth] takes shoe
				title deed
				marriage license
			Jebusite's tattered shoes
			John B's sandals
	First Mention
		= the first mention of a thing has special significance
		'things' often develop from simple to complex (or vice versa)
		idealogical coloring
		! interesting but, what order do you put the books in?
		valid: [Gen 3:22] -> [Rev 22] tree of life
		invalid: most things not mentioned in Pentateuch
	The Stereo Law
		an identical mention of a thing in another context has special significance
		e.g. quotations from the Septuagint
			{Septuagint}
		e.g. "Nazarene" passages
			{Nazarene}
	Cardinality
		the order in which items appear in a list are important
		I'm not prepared to comment on the order in which things appear between the Bible books because they are typically in neither chronological nor their original order (the order is not inspired)
	Dichotomies
		hetero-?
		many Biblical ideas are forehead-slappers
			many of these involve an understanding of time/space that we cannot have
		election vs. calling
		trinity
	Structural Integrity
		the Bible pre-answers [divisive] heresies before they are invented
		John 1:1
		John 12 ()
	Remez Principle (a hint of something deeper)
		[Matt 16:5-12]
			Do ye not _yet_ understand

		[Rev 19:9-10]

		[Ps 119:2,10] - the benefits of seeking


		[Matt 21:15-16]
			A) by saying 'hosanna' the people implied Jesus to be the Savior
			B) when Jesus quotes [Ps 8:2] he [partially] implies that the Pharisees are enemies of God
			Jesus quotes [Ps 8:2] in response to their indignation, but He leaves out the 2nd part of the verse "to still the enemy" - the Pharisees were very likely to have picked up on this
		[Gen 22:9]
			It says Abraham and Isaac went up, but it doesn't _say_ that Isaac came down - Isaac doesn't appear again until he is with his bride [Gen 24:62+]
		[Acts 7]
			Israel blew it, made it up, blew it, made it up, blew it...then Stephen is cut off - what's due next?!
		[Luke 4:18-19]	
			Jesus quotes [Is 61:1-2a] but stops mid-sentence.  The rest of the sentence is: "and the day of vengeance of our God"
		Cities of Refuge
			[Num 35]

	Inductive

	Midrashic
		PaRDes
		- Peshat ~ surface meaning
		- Remez ~ hint of deeper things
		- Derash ~ comparative meaning (metaphor, analogy)
		- Midrash ~ the mystery or philosophy
		- Sod ~ hidden meanings
