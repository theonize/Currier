# Logos
...the psyche behind the idea.


Scripture is said to be _theopneustos_ and living and active. 
In light of variant texts and translations it behoves us to perceive that their is an intellect behind the progressive revelation of the Scripture. 
This is the Logos.
It is not that Scripture morphs or otherwise changes but is constantly renewed-
it's power carries to the hearer regardless of the mouth or tongue.
