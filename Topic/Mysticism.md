# Mysticism
...the belief that an item or practice has an import beyond the senses or mind. 

## Spirit

It is not a stretch to hold a mystical view of spiritual enlightenment [or growth] because the soul is also transcendental.


## Mind

Mysticism holds that there can be new knowledge or intellect imparted to us by unknown means.
The origin and purpose of this knowledge be evident even without the metaknowledge.
* Daniel 12:4, knowledge to and fro 
* Prophecy (specifics and patterns)


## Body

Mysticism holds that physical items and practices can attain and hold untraceable power.
As above, though the origin and means of imputation are unknown the effects are perceivable.
* Teleportation of apostles in Acts
* Elijah's super powers


## Examples

* The sacrament of bread & wine:
  * These items are not directly transsubstantiated to the flesh and blood they represent
  * However, they do eventually become these things through biochemical processes.
  * Additionally, they attain the power of the association.
  * This power comes via the association to the Christ regardless of the state of the priest or the consumer.
* Scripture:
  * Inspiration is the view that God had a hand in the creation of Bible texts;  variants debate the extent of God's involvement. 
  * A high view of Scripture holds that the original text is inerrant, which exalts it's authority. 
  * A low view of Scripture (that retains inspiration) can still respect it's holistic message and authority.
  * Reading Scripture is thought, by Bible authors and ancestral believers, to deliver the Logos of the sacred text to people.
