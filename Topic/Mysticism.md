# Mysticism
...the belief that an item or practice has an import beyond the senses or mind. 

## Spirit

It is not a stretch to hold a mystical view of spiritual enlightenment [or growth] because the soul is also transcendental.


## Mind

Mysticism holds that there can be new knowledge or intellect imparted to us by unknown means.
The origin and purpose of this knowledge be evident even without the metaknowledge.


## Body

Mysticism holds that physical items and practices can attain and hold untraceable power.
As above, though the origin and means of imputation are unknown the effects are perceivable.

  * Additionally, they attain the power of the association.
  * This power comes via the association to the Christ regardless of the state of the priest or the consumer.
* Scripture reading:
