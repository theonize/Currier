# Retribution

Retribution theology is the belief that God punishes sinners in this life.
This belief is based on the idea that God is just and that sin must be punished.
Retribution theology is found in many religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

However, this is not [precisely] a Biblical concept.
The Bible does show God exacting revenge on wicked people and nations.
The Bible also shows the suffering of righteous people.
Which, it is important to note, are not righteous in, and of, themselves but they are those God declares righteous.
We also the opposite in the Bible- wicked people and nations who prosper.

So, we begin to pare the issue down to its essentials: punishment, revenge, and ransom.

Note that God does not seek revenge on his children.
He may allow their suffering but it is not retributive.
God eventually seeks revenge against the wicked on behalf of his children (though not often on our timetable.)

There are two major issues with this train of thought:
1. The Biblical text does not support the idea that God punishes directly, let alone to exact revenge.
   Whatever payment, ransom, was required for the sins of man was paid by Jesus' death.
   God certainly causes suffering by His actions but the suffering is not the intent, the intent is the salvation of as many as possible.
2. We run afoul of treating God like a vendor: we follow certain rules and get good out, we do wrong and get bad out.
   This is not Biblical either but is a predominant belief in the mainstream Church.
   There are deeper concerns here than just having our expectations unmet.
   When we treat God as an input/output machine we are heretically idolizing ourselves as arbiters trying to usurp him and reenact His works.
   This is similar to the reformers issue with transubstantiation- if the body & blood are literally present then, they argue, we are reenacting the sacrifice of Christ which gives us control.

There is some room for nuance in these issues.
It often comes down to 
But the important takeaway is that
