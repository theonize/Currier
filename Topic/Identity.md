# Identity
...sameness, distinctiveness 
~ from identitatem- same meaning


## Same as What?

Metaphysically, our identity is a determination of ways we are distinct from and similar to others.
  e.g. human/not, male/female, efiminate/macho
There are many points of overlap with other creatures
...but also many distinctives: those things that make us individual.
The points of comparison may be physical, spiritual, mental.
"You're unique, just like everyone else."

However, our perception is exposed by our lack of sense.
i.e. "You're just a spoiled suburban girl who thinks she's being a rebel by doing what every other suburban girl does."

1Cor 15:3-10
especially "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain."
- This is the providential nature AND nurture of our development
- God can, and does, change our identity; i.e. we can be adopted into His family; i.e. formative life events

"I'm a natural-born leader/entertainer/etc." is nonsense.
It is a mistake to conflate behavioral and vocational aptitude with identity.
Charisma, timing, and speech are learned and, though they may be enhanced by beauty, vision, and natural ability.
Such things are what we do, not who we are.
Cultivating abilities are a way to reveal, or codify, our identity.

"I identify as a <gender>" is also a nonsense statement because we cannot change our identity.
We may grow into it; i.e. learn what it is and understand it better.
It is a revelation to us.


## Who Am I

We glean our identity four ways:
1. 3rd party ~ someone tells you
2. Experience ~ learning/study, events or teachers
4. Rumination ~ introspection, reflecting on the tapestry of truth made of the threads of life
3. Mystical ~ experiencing the interplay of nature and ability


There are 6 ways we intersect with others.
Thus, 6 ways our true identity is exposed in utility.
...hence, the 6 pieces of armor in [Eph 6]()
- truth ~ testimony; facts & striving to understand them
- righteousness ~ ethics & morality;  determining what is right and doing it
- salvation ~ destiny; the hope of were/are/will-be moving away from harm
- message ~ evangel; preparation for peace...beyond the  war-zone
- faith ~ belief; working with conviction
- spirit ~ capability; working with empowerment


## Components of Identity

Humanity

Gender

Sinfulness

Belief/Unbelief

Guilt/Innocence


## What We Want vs Are

We often displace our perception of our actual self with what we desire to be.
Thus, discovering our identity necessarily requires us to dispose of error and ignorance.


## The Razor's Edge

Jacob/Israel epitomizes the identity crisis:
  when acting apart from God he is called Jacob
  when walking with God he is called Israel


# Exposition

What things expose our true identity?

How does identity, and our view of it, intertwine with character?  Put another way: what happens in us when we don't see our true identity?
