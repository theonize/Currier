# Identity
...sameness
~ from identitatem- same meaning


## Same as What?

Our identity, metaphysically, is our determination of how we are both distinct from and similar to others.
The points of comparison may be physical, spiritual, mental.
"You're unique, just like everyone else."

There are 6 ways we intersect with others: destiny, morality, truth, faith, communication, marketing
...hence, the 6 pieces of armor in [Eph 6]()


We glean our identity four ways:
1. 3rd party ~ someone tells you
2. Experience ~ learning from events or teachers
3. Mystical ~ understanding of the nature of the identity as it applies to you
4. Wisdom ~ seeing a tapestry of truth pertaining to the identity


## Components of Identity

Humanity

Gender

Sinful 

Belief...or not

Guilt...or not


## What We Want vs Are


## The Razor's Edge

Jacob/Israel epitomizes the identity crisis:
  when acting apart from God he is called Jacob
  when walking with God he is called Israel


# Exposition

What things expose our true identity?

How does identity, and our view of it, intertwine with character?
