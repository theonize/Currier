# Bible

The term "bible" is derived from the Greek word "biblia" which means "books". The Bible we now have is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures.

That the term Bible has become synonymous with the Christian scriptures is a result of: 1) the providential flow of historical actors in developing it and 2) the literary catholic nature of the material.

Here we use the term "catholic" in its technical sense, meaning universal (rather than its colloquial sense, meaning the Roman Catholic denomination.)

It is foundational, in Bible study, to understand the inspired nature of the texts.
Most people who interact with Biblical texts do so with limited and/or flawed understandings of inspiration.
