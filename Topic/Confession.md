# Confession


Confession of sin, or blessing, is sacramental.

Speaking a confession aloud is both cathartic and necessary.
It gives voice to our issues and makes them real, tangible.

Confession to another believer is also necessary-
it adds the strength of their Holy Spirit to the aphantic supplication.


## Voice of God

"If you want to hear the audible voice of God: read His word aloud."

We are a voice of God when we speak His words.
