# Introspection

In general this is gleaning or resolving truths from within a thing.
Theologically, this is the idea of extracting and exposing truths from within.


## Proof

Re: Richard Dawkins- if you dismantle an organization you can discern many things about the ecosystem it came from.
For example, a bird's wings tell you about the makeup of the atmosphere.
Likewise, it's CNS tells you about the earth magnetosphere.


## Disproof

It is unreasonable to expect a thing to have knowledge or wisdom beyond it's capability.
