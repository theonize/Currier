# Fasting

Fasting is the act of abstaining from something for a period of time.
Typically we think of fasting as abstaining from food, but it can be anything.
Some Christian traditions have seasons of fasting where patrons will give up something dear to them for a period of time.


## Outcomes

There can be dramatic, positive outcomes from fasting.
Giving up a hobby for a time can help our mind reset and restructure to regain the original joy of the thing.
Giving up food has several effects (after about 24hrs):
- less blood flow in the gut means more [potential] blood flow to the brain
- our body goes through an intensive process of internal recycling and house-cleaning
- a recommended book in this regard is "God's Chosen Fast" by Arturh Wallis


## Purposes

Aside from the practical benefits of fasting, there are spiritual benefits as well.
In fact, these benefits ought to be the primary inclination for fasting because there is a sense in which they can only be had from fasting.
In contrast to the aforemetioned physical/psychic benefits which can be gotten through other means.
- e.g. vigorous exercise can produce many of the same benefits as fasting
- e.g. flooding or vacations can yield psychic health benefits

Unfortunately, religious fasting is often just a way for religious leaders to promote themselves.
Jesus railed against this in Matthew 6:16-18.
And this mindset is a scriptural imperative from the Old Testament as well (Isaiah 58:1-14).
vv6-7 are particularly poignant: why skip ahead to fasting when we haven't done the basics of loving our neighbors?


## Examples

David fasted when his infant son was sick (2 Samuel 12:16-23).

Jesus fasted and prayed for 40 days before beginning his ministry (Matthew 4:1-11).
