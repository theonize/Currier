# Kingdom of Heaven of God


"The Kingdom of Heaven" is a Jewish circumlocution for "The Kingdom of God" to avoiding unncessary use of the word _God_.
	Dr. Michael Heiser

...while Kingdom of Heaven is synonymous with Kingdom of God there is significance in the transition of the term: heaven has come to Earth and the work continues, based out of the new, ubiquitous, living Temple.


[Mark 11:30]
[Luke 15:18,21]


[Luke 17:21] ~ KoH = spiritual, within the Temple/Church
[Rev 11:15] ~ KoH will be physical (?corporeal?) one day

		Leaven is often hermeneutically sin
		How is God's kingdom equated with sin?
		It's not, it is - however - a spiritual work.

		Perhaps it's just pushing the analogy too far...
		...but I think it's apt because of the nature of the change wrought by yeast:
		Yeast works through fermentation which chemically alters the host and causes gaseous release which puffs up the host.
		Both of these are beneficial to the baker...
		[Rom 7:7] ~ were it not for sin we would never know our need for Him
		Perhaps the dichotomy is resolved in the two lives of the Church: private worship and public interaction.
