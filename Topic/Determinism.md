# Determinism


Does God know all that will come to pass?

Does God **ordain** all that will come to pass?
- Westminster Confession says "God from all eternity did by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass."

Does God cause evil acts (rape, murder) to occur so that He will receive glory?


The rub is that we cannot reconcile a good, just God with the causation of sin.
We are not fully able to reconcile these but we can begin toward it by understanding the term "ordain".

To ordain a thing means to provide the framework in which the lil instantiates.

It is commensurate with the use of the term "ordination" in terms of preparing a minister for service.
This person is trained and _framed_ in a system of beliefs and practices that enable good ministry.
Otherwise the minister would just tumbleweed through their ministry and [likely] fail.

Determinism is similar, but in much grander terms, in that God creates the framework within good or evil acts can occur.

Intellectual honesty demands that we ask why God allows either good or evil acts.
Why does God allow rape...ordination of the system.
Why does God allow forgiveness...same...
Also, does God enable these things?
The level to which God micro-manages event determines the both the extent of His culpability and our volition.

The wording above is important, God did not _decree_ (i.e. cause) but _ordained_ (i.e. enabled) evil...and good.
Enabling simply implies creating the circumstance in which something can occur...I think this is obviously true.
Ordaining is less nuanced because from ordination we can infer God's intent to allow good and evil.
If we pre-suppose (gasp!) that God is good (don't worry we can derive this later) then it must be that the best plan is one where we have just enough constraint to be able to freely choose His side but not too much where we _must_ choose it.

God did not _decree_ sin:
- Jeremiah 19:5
- 1 John 2:16
- James 1:13-17

God regularly determines obedience in the OT.
If everything is predetermined then why would God voice these requirements?
Further, why wouldn't God be glad in **all** human behavior since it is all ordained by Him?

Our character is not pre-determined, but it is predcetermined that if we follow Christ our character will be conformed to His.
