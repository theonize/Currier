The Peter Principle


Author Lawrence Peter created _The Peter Principle_, which states: "Every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."
Two corollaries fill out this principle:
  (1) In time, every post tends to be occupied by someone who is incompetent to carry out his duties, and
  (2) work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.

There are several unhealthy, unprincipled coping mechanisms employed by the incompetent:
  Scapegoating
  ...casting blame onto another

  False-foci
  ...redirecting attention where it should not be; i.e. onto a subordinate or an unworthy leader

  Unhumility
  ...a brand of falseness where pretend grace and mercy are given for selfish ends.


Biblically:
  There is a limit to our abilities

  [2COR 3:5]  Our sufficiency is from God (i.e. adequacy, enablement)

  [1KGS 22]  People don't want to hear what they don't want to hear.

  One who is gifted to pastor is not, necessarily, also a teacher, preacher, or administrator.
Omnicompetence is a myth.
Pastors are, unrightly, expected to be expert in commendation (interpersonal skills), emendation (corrective leadership), and proclamation (preaching).
