Salt


In ancient times salt was:
- a preservative
- a condiment 
- very precious

The salt they used was not pure salt as we have today but, often, diluted by other minerals (or dirt).


## Lifeblood

Meat with blood in it was forbidden to Israelites because of the life-taking connection.
Meat "treated" or rendered with salt was good to eat...barring cookery.

Interesting parallel with the Church:
	The world = [Mic 3:1-3]
	Believers = [Matt 5:13]


## Preservative

perhaps the greatest service we do for the world is as vessels for the Holy Spirit; when we are absent the situation always degrades

	


## Flavoring

[Lev 2:13]() 
- salt on every grain offering
- salt represents _the_ covenant
- "must" put salt on all your offerings [Rom 12:1-2]()

[Job 6:6]()
- unsavory things "must" be eaten with salt


## Covenant

[Lev 2:13]()
[Num 18:19]()
[1Chr 13:5]()
