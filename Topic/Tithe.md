# The Tithe

The tithe is, literally, "the tenth".
Our vernacular has it as the sum of our giving.
The modern, western, christian standard of giving is 10% of the gross income.
Most give less than this, some give more.
Biblical giving was 22.5%, by law, because they gave a tenth twice plus other offerings.
We see in the Bible giving rates as high as 100% (the widow and her mites (whom Jesus publically honored)).
