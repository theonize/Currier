# Disappointment

You cannot disappoint God.  Disappointment comes from unmet expectations.  God foreknows what to expect of us.

We get disappointed because we fabricated expectations and respond according to them.  The pragmatism of the gospel is that God works all things for good.

The ultimate lack of sense is formulating expectations of things we cannot control.  The ultimate deception is that we can control anything apart from God's provision.
