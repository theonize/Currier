# Forgiveness


Why don't we sell forgiveness?
- we don't know we need it
  - we are anesthetized or ignorant
  - we are afraid

... We don't need to be afraid,
look what God did with Manasseh or Saul

How does God forgive?
- completely
- immediately
- repeatedly
- inherently [Matt 6:14-15]
