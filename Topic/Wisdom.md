# Wisdom


[Job 28:28]() ~ wisdom = fear of the Lord
[Deut 4:6]() ~ wisdom = "keeping" and doing the laws

[Proverbs 8]() - wisdom is a person, a living thing.
We may consider personification of ephemeral things trite but they do move and work and are quantifiable.
As a person she is female.

[Proverbs 4]() - wisdom is obtainable. 
Whatever she is, she can be gotten.
