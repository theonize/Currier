# Wisdom


[Job 28:28]() ~ wisdom = fear of the Lord
[Deut 4:6]() ~ wisdom = "keeping" and doing the laws

[Proverbs 8]()

Wisdom is described as a thing, almost like a commodity or currency.
Interestingly, when we learn something it makes a physical change in our brain.
It is much the same as when we "put" a file onto a digital storage device.
When you store a file on a flash-drive, the drive doesn't get heavier because you haven't physically moved something to it- you have simply caused the bits in the storage medium to re-arrange themselves to encode the new information.
In the same way, when we learn something, our brain doesn't get heavier, but the connections between neurons change to encode the new information.

So, wisdom is a thing that we can acquire and possess.
However, it is not tangible- it is patterns of patterns of information.
=======
[Proverbs 8]() - wisdom is a person, a living thing.
We may consider personification of ephemeral things trite but they do move and work and are quantifiable.
As a person she is female.

[Proverbs 4]() - wisdom is obtainable. 
Whatever she is, she can be gotten.


Wisdom is female, Logos is male.
Wisdom is a bounding concept, Logos is binding.
