# Philosophy

philo-sophy ~ love of wisdom

We generaly regard philosophy as an extant art of reasoning about truths and principles. It is a discipline that seeks to understand the nature of reality and knowledge.

**A philosophy** is a set of beliefs that describe how someone approaches life.


## Biblical Philosophy

Jesus did not come the offer _a philosophy_, He came to offer a relationship (in fact, a peace treaty) with God.
However, the mind shaped by the Holy Spirit, through the Bible, will have a certain philosophy.
Not all believers will share the same philosophy, but all will share the same Spirit.
So, it important to 1) be open and able to update our philosophy when sufficiently moved and 2) find as many points of overlap with other Biblical Christians' philosophies as possible.
Because these are our allies and compatriots with whom we must serve and on whom we must rely.


## Sufficiency

Philosophy is not sufficient for life.
It is a set of tools we use to navigate various terrains.
Though it is not what ultimately connects us to others it is an important element.

Paul was well versed in both Greek philosophy and Jewish theology.
He quotes several thinkers of his age:
* Epimenides of Crete [Titus 1:12]
* Aratus of Cilicia [Acts 17:28]
* Menander of Athens [1Cor 15:33]

In a sense, the Holy Spirit imported these human wisdom into the Bible via Paul.
We expect that there are many more such importations throughout the Bible, some sourced and some not.
So, this should enlighten us that some human wisdom is quite good and useful in the Christian life.
It is not that Biblical wisdom is built on human wisdom, but that God has delivered wisdom through human experience: this is part of the parcel of general revelation.

To those who would reject the usage of "secular" sources in the Church training I submit that there are many external sources which have been drawn into the Bible:
* Epimenides of Crete [Titus 1:12]
* Aratus of Cilicia [Acts 17:28]
* Menander of Athens [1Cor 15:33]
Not to mention non-believers who contributed directly to the Old Testament:
* Balaam [Numbers 22-24]
* Nebuchadnezzar [Daniel 4]
* Cyrus [Isaiah 45:1-7]
It comes down to who you think created the Bible you hold in your hands: was it God?  If so, did He allow anything into it against His will?
It merely shows that God has dispensed wisdom and knowledge through many channels and it is our folly to ignore or deify them.
The outcome of those are fundamentalism and disbelief [via syncretism].
