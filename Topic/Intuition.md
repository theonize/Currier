# Intuition

We say something is "intuitive" if it can be known or utilized without study or conscious effort.
Thereby intuition is a function which yields a result without evidence.

Whether a thing is arbitrary, intuitive, or decreed depends on what level of reasoning is required and quality of the output.
An arbitrary decision is basically a chance decision, not reasoning was had and also no valid basis for the decision.
An intuitive decision does have a basis and is typically known to follow some measure of understanding in that domain.
A decree is simply a decision which is pre-decided based on the proclivities of the decider.


## Not Analysis

If you sit an examine a chart of data and see a missing point, you may be able to figure out what the missing point is without calculation.
But this is not intuition.
One may have intuition about charts of data that generalizes throughout an industry (for example) but this is not extrapolation or interpolation based on calculation.


## Not _A Priori_

Intuition does not stem from truths which are based on definitions.
Saying "that man is a bachelor" is true if he is unmarried.
It is true because of the definition of the words.
There is no intuition involved in making such a determination.

However, it may very well be an intuitive leap to determine whether a man is married or not if there is not enough information to make a _reasonable_ determination.


## Training and Genetics

Intuition may very well be a function of training and nature.
We take it as a given that genetics, psyche, and spirit all shape our nature.
Yet, we also know that circumstances shape us as well.
Intuition is specific to certain domains.
It is also trainable- which means our intuitions are falsifiable and correctable.
