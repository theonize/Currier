# Consciousness

= a framework with which things perceive

It is a part of our nature that allows us to model our world.
Other, congruent elements of our nature are
- intellect, capacity to reason
- sentience, ability to act
- physicality, actionability
- psyche, emotional breadth
The amount of, and interaction between, these elements conditions a things capability.

Consciousness is given to, not created by, us.

Consciousness is closely related to spirituality ~ the notion that there is a transcendental portion of man.

Non-soulish creatures have consciousness.
...soulish creatures are those who have advanced predictive capabilities

Creativity is the sole differentiator between soulish and truly spiritual creatures.



## Dualism

~ the idea that the body and mind are separate

Genome ~ the blueprint of the body

Connectome ~ neural software (wetware)
