# Answers to Prayer

## Does God answer prayers?

Yes, and not only does He know our asks before they are, He eagerly awaits our offering of them.


## When does God answer prayers? 

It seems that God must answer prayers immediately. 
Though an answer may be immediately _no_ it is God's purview to eventually answer in the affirmative. 
God does repent, change His mind, by His own design upon the repentance and application of humans.
