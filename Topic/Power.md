# Power

Reconciling the worldly, human view of power and God's nature.


The 48 Laws of Power, written by Robert Greene, is a guide to strategies and tactics for gaining and maintaining power. Here’s a summary of each law:

Never outshine the master: Make those above you feel superior, and avoid showing off your talents too much.
* This is an interesting mellange of Biblical principles and anti-instinct.
  Our desire to shine is natural, as is our desire to be in control, but not all natural things are good.
  In practice, edifying others is the best way to gain allies and attain goals.
  Cloistering you potential, or cloaking it, is often effective as a gauge of other's intentions and worthiness.
  It is not a sin to withhold oneself from someone who would take advantage of you.
  It is also not a sin to distance yourself from those who cannot or will not make use of your talents.
  Groups of people who lift each other up are quite fruitful and successful and elevate those who are most necessary for the current task.
  We cannot outshine Christ and you say one part of the Christian mission is to make others shine brighter.

Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies: Friends can betray, but enemies will be more reliable when converted.
* This is a very Machiavellian principle that, while not destructive, is not necessarily constructive either.
  In the Church we are called to be the stones that make up the Temple.
  We do not concern ourselves with the arrangement of them or the mortar that holds them together.
  Further, there is cognitive dissonance to the idea that someone is a friend who has betrayed, or and enemy who is allied.
  Once that change has occurred the betrayer is no longer a friend, the ally is no longer an enemy.
  Regardless, though the analogy becomes a little more brittle, sometimes stones are removed or added- the architect is skilled enough to handle the changes.

Conceal your intentions: Hide your plans to prevent others from getting ahead of you.
* We need consider whether its a bad thing for another person to be ahead of us.
  It is certainly sinful to "run over" another person, but not a sin to be behind or beneath them.
  Certainly, it is not a sin to be downtrodden or oppressed.
  As with the previous points: it can be beneficial to withhold yourself from others and it can be beneficial to edify others.
  In fact, Christians are called to do these very things **for their enemies**.
  Sometimes shrewdness is necessary, but it is not a virtue, it is a tool

Always say less than necessary: Power comes from being mysterious and unpredictable.
* Echoed in Proverbs, "Even a fool who keeps his mouth shut is considered wise."
  Perhaps we should say, "Always say enough, then stop."
  Which goes hand-in-hand with the concept of meekness: keep control of your words.

So much depends on reputation – guard it with your life: Your reputation is a foundation of power; protect it at all costs.
* This is essential for gospel ministers- perhaps above all else.
  However, it is an easy task to guard one's reputation when one is ethical.
  And, when you have skeletons in the closet, forthrightness is the best policy.
  We should not be in the business of _building reputation_ but _maintaining integrity_.
  A good reputation naturally follows a life of service to other

Court attention at all costs: Be bold and attract attention to establish your presence.
* "Do you see a man skliled in his labor, he will server before kings." Proverbs 22:29
  It is reasonable to expect success when we work hard, especially at something for which we are talented.
  However, seeking the limelight is anathema to the gospel- it will be thrust upon at a time of God's choosing for His purposes.
  If Christians are to _court_ anything, it is opportunity to provide charitable service.
  Giving grace and mercy is bold and will attract attention.
  Further, it leaves no room naysayers to criticize.

Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit: Use others' efforts to achieve your own goals.
* This is not a sustainable practice.
  Even from a purely materialistic standpoint, once you've used up your compatriots not only will you have no accomplices left but you will not be able to work.
  Giving credit and lifting others, by contract, is infinitely sustainable and yields actual power through strength of reputation and numbers.

Make other people come to you – use bait if necessary: Don’t chase others, let them come to you on your terms.
* This is nearly good advice.
  Seekers are seeking what they need by their very nature.
  The question is: to what lengths will they go in the seeking?
  Providence provides connections to other people, we need only be ready to minister.
  Goodness is the bait.

Win through your actions, never through argument: Prove your point through results, not through words.
Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky: Misery spreads like a disease, avoid those who drag you down.
Learn to keep people dependent on you: Make yourself indispensable to maintain control.
Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim: A single act of honesty can cover up deceit later.
When asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude: People will act if they see something in it for themselves.
Pose as a friend, work as a spy: Gather information from those around you by making them feel safe.
Crush your enemy totally: Leave no room for revenge, completely destroy your opposition.
Use absence to increase respect and honor: Leave when your presence is no longer necessary, and make people miss you.
Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability: Being unpredictable makes others anxious and easier to manipulate.
Do not build fortresses to protect yourself – isolation is dangerous: Engage with the world to stay informed and connected.
Know who you’re dealing with – do not offend the wrong person: Be aware of the people around you and their power.
Do not commit to anyone: Stay independent and avoid making long-term commitments.
Play a sucker to catch a sucker – seem dumber than your mark: Lower others' defenses by appearing less intelligent or capable.
Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power: By conceding in the short term, you can gain power in the long term.
Concentrate your forces: Focus your resources and energy where they will have the greatest impact.
Play the perfect courtier: Master the art of flattering and navigating complex power dynamics.
Re-create yourself: Never be afraid to reinvent yourself and control your own narrative.
Keep your hands clean: Let others do the dirty work while maintaining an unblemished reputation.
Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult-like following: Use faith and hope to manipulate and control others.
Enter action with boldness: Hesitation is dangerous; be decisive and act with confidence.
Plan all the way to the end: Think through every possibility to avoid surprises and ensure success.
Make your accomplishments seem effortless: Always conceal the effort it took to achieve success.
Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal: Limit the choices of others to ensure the outcome benefits you.
Play to people’s fantasies: People are drawn to the extraordinary, so offer illusions instead of reality.
Discover each man’s thumbscrew: Find others' weaknesses and use them to your advantage.
Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one: Confidence and self-assurance will command respect.
Master the art of timing: Success often depends on striking at the right moment.
Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge: By not acknowledging what you can’t have, you reduce its power over you.
Create compelling spectacles: Capture attention with grand gestures and events.
Think as you like, but behave like others: To blend in and avoid unnecessary attention, conform outwardly.
Stir up waters to catch fish: Create chaos to force others to act rashly, making them easier to manipulate.
Despise the free lunch: Always pay your way to avoid being controlled by others.
Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes: Forge your own path rather than following someone else's.
Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter: Remove powerful leaders to disorganize and weaken their followers.
Work on the hearts and minds of others: Appeal to emotions and loyalties rather than coercion.
Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect: Mimic your enemies' actions to unsettle them and make them lose control.
Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once: Gradual change is easier to accept than sudden transformation.
Never appear too perfect: Flaws and vulnerabilities make you more relatable and less threatening.
Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop: Knowing when to stop is key to maintaining power.
Assume formlessness: Be flexible and adaptable to survive in a world of constant change.
