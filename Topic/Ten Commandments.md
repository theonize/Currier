# 10 Commandments 

The historically canonical 10 commandments are from Exodus 22:

1. No God's before Yahweh
2. No idols
3. Don't take Yahweh's name in vain
4. Keep the Sabbath 
5. Honor father & mother
6. No murder
7. No adultery 
8. No theft
9. No lying against neighbors
10. No coveting neighbors or their materiel

Throughout the development of the Jews and, later, the Church, these were considered the heart of the Godly ethic.

However, these are not the tablets of the law that went into the ark.
Neither did Jesus consider these the Pinnacle if the law.
Recall that He was specifically asked and answered the love of God _plus_ love of neighbor is preeminent.

When Moses first met God atop Mt. Sinai he was given tablets on which **God inscribed** the law.
Upon returning they found that Israel had already abandoned Yahweh.
Moses, angered, broke the tablets.
Later, after some corrective action, he carved the law onto some new tablets.
These are the tablets that went into the Ark.

So, what was on those tablets?
