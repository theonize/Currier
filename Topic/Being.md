# Being

A __being__ is a complex collection of matter.
An __inanimate__ being is one that cannot willfully act upon it's environment.

## Creatures 

__Consciousness__ is a beings ability to perceive it's environment.
__Intelligenxe__ is a beings ability to understand it's environment.
__Sentience__ is a beings awareness of itself.

These three are not boolean, they exist on a spectrum.

e.g. consciousness
- the sun is immensely massive but has almost no perception, it simply responds to gravity and heat.  It has infinitesimal consciousness.
- a human has many sensing capabilities that even transcend the physical.  It has high consciousness.

e.g. intelligence
- a glass of water has almost no understanding of it's environment.  Things like capillarity and phase changes are involuntary and it's reactions are very low-level.
- a wasp's senses are attuned to find food and water.  It willfully build nests in safe locations near these necessities.  It also perceives threat's and responds with violence which can escalate based on the response.

e.g. sentience
- a rock has, practically, zero sentience (nor consciousness nor intellect).  It has no perceivable sense of self.
- a slime mold can grow in such a way that it navigates mazes (via an optimal solution) to acquire nutrients.  This behavior is driven by a keen sense of all it's parts and environs.  However, it cannot be given commands to do a certain thing.


Replacement of one sense with another is a hallmark of a highly conscious being.
e.g. if a person loses their sight both the brain and their mind adapt and evolve to make up for the loss.

Transcendence is the capability of a being to perform actions which are complex competitions of simpler abilities.
e.g. walking; walking while talking; walking and talking while dribbling a basketball- at each level of complexity the previous ability becomes instinctive and automatic.  We often perform mental and spiritual acts which rely on previously learned physical actions...likr playing an instrument and singing while worshipping.
