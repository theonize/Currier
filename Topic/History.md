The Bible is not a history book, but it does detail many historical events.
It is important to recognize the difference between ancient historical narrative and modern historical records.
Modern historical works tend to give a sequence of events with sporadic illucidation.
Ancient historical works tend to narrate a story with enough details to give you a context in time and space.

In many cases the primary goal of an ancient writing was not to make a historical record.
For example, the Bible is a theological book in which history is secondary.
This does not mean historical accuracy is lacking, but that it is woven in with enough important detail to verify the place and characters.

This does mean the narrative style is less valid than our modern style.
In fact, the modern style typically foregoes the story elements in favor of facts.
This means that recovering the humanity of events requires gleaning human nuggets from many historical records.

We should not haste to dismiss ancient historical accounts because they do not align with our methods of record.
Ancient authors were greatly constrained by publishing methods and expended great energy recording important events in a way that was terse and yet profound.
