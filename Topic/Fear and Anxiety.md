# Fear and Anxiety

"Fear not"; i.e. "Don't let your heart be troubled."

It is not possible to [naturally] eliminate the emotion of fear- that is an instinctive reaction.
The Biblical sense is not that- it is the response to that emotion;  i.e. not cowering _in fear_ but acting in spite.


Fear gets smaller as you move toward it.


Stress is trying to take God's responsibility on ourselves.


e.g.
- David fleeing
- Elijah fleeing after Carmel
- Jesus sweat blood


"There can be no courage without fear."

Jesus said "fear not" around 90 times

fear ~ phobos ...
agony ~ agonia ...
anxiety ~ merimna ...split mind, the distracting cleavage of worry


## Dealing

[Phil 4:6]() ~ through prayer and supplication
* prayer ~ proseuche ... proximity, i.e. away from the world, toward God 
* supplication ~ deysis ... entreaty from privation
