# Blessing(s)

`A blessing is the promotion of well-being in another.`

Biblically speaking: we often miss blessed circumstances where the benefitt comes [much] later than the act.
This is part-in-parcel with Romans 8:28, where God works all things for the good of those who love Him;
God's timing is not the same as ours, nor in the same domain as ours.
Additionally, our notions of good are often vastly overshadowed by His.


## Nuts & Bolts

God blessed them and said, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.  
  Genesis 1:28  

God blessed humans for a reason: the blessing was meant to facilitate what comes next.
We're not given the specific nature of the blessing, simply the implication that it contributed ot the following:

* Fruitfulness
* Multiplication
* Filling the earth
* Subduing the earth


## Fruitful

Fruitfulness means to generatte produce that is beneficial.
The analogous nature of the word is obvious;
fruit is nourishing, contains seeds, and is (pragmatically) the only reason a hungry creature approaches a tree.

It is notable that fruitfulness is distinguished from the following decrees: multiplication and reproduction.
Thus, we can infer that fruitfulness is simply the production of seeds and the palatability thereof.


## Reproduce

Multiplication is some combination of reproduction via birth and discipleship.
We have the decree to make more of ourselves.
It should not be lost on us that this can rightly be genetic, genealogical, and vocational.
We are bound by our nature, and our relationship with the creator, to reproduce.


## Spread

We are not to cloister and segragate.
This not only leads to incest of the body and mind but the displacement of others that we ought to be ministering to.
This is a precursor to Jesus' command to go to all nations and make disciples.
It is unhealthy and unproductive to stay amongst our own in one place.
We cannot presume to make a case against the restfulness of home but it seems clear that we cannot always stay there and have any effect on the nations.


## Subdue

There is a connotation of force behind the word subdue.
It is about forcing the earth into submissiong.
This about governance: whether for good or ill is up to the motivator.
