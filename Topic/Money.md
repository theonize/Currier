# Money

If I have $20 it is proof that I have (ostensibly) done an amount of work equivalent to that amount of money. 
This is a foundational economic principle which abstracts us away from the barter system.
Barter only works if both parties have goods the other is interested in. 

The problem of money- the love of it- is problematic because we move beyond earning to meet needs or even meet contentments and into scoring our value relative to others.
While we may create a great deal of value (hence, have extra money) this excess is mostly given by God for charitability.

Funding ministry and investing for future gain are godly expenditures.
