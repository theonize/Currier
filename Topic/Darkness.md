# Darkness


Darkness is the absence of light.
Darkness is the abode of wickedness.
Generally we assume that because we cannot see we cannot be seen.
However, God sees because there is radiation beyond the visible spectrum that He can perceive.

There is also spiritual darkness that clouds our consciousness.
When we are in this darkness we assume that we are hidden, some even find their safety there.
But there is a spectrum of consciousness outside what we can perceive- which God can see.
