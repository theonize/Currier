# Crisis
~ from the same Greek word,
  the root of which is `krie` ~ to sieve, a mechanism of separation
...decisive point in the progress of a disease
...a point at which change is coming, for better or worse

The change may be recovery or death.


A German term for "mid-life crisis" is Torschlusspanik, literally "shut-door-panic," fear of being on the wrong side of a closing gate.


When a crisis comes change will happen.
Fear often accompanies our predelection of the change;
But, without fear there is no opportunity for courage.
Often the outcome results from our expectations.
...which often fall short of what should be.

Ultimately the outcome is determined by the sovereign, one who is in control.


The design of a tree is contained within it's nature, it's DNA
- But it must become a tree through time & trial
- Without wind & storms a tree is never forced to grow roots.
