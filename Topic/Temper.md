# Temper

There is an interesting, layered aggregation which makes up the temperment of a human.
A human is conscious, intelligent, sentient, and moral (morality being the understanding of right&wrong, not necessarily proper ethics.)
Knowledge of these attributes constitutes a higher level of capability.
Engaging these attributes is a yet higher level.
Temperment is the instantiation of a humans capability based on these attributes.
