Fear ~ a feeling of profound respect
...fear for our life is an instance of profound respect of a person wielding the power to take it.

Without fear there can be no courage.
Courage is acting in spite of fear.
Such action requires a hope or calculation of success.

Most who encoutered God were undone but some interacted with Him.
Though they were profoundly afraid they were not paralyzed- they knew a history of God's love for His people and hoped that it would continue.

Millenia later, we have a larger hope resting on the acts of God in the mean-time.


{Job 28:28}
	wisdom = fear of the Lord
	understanding = turn away from evil

{Ps 19:9}
	fear of the Lord is clean ~ its always appropriate, always right

{Ps 34:11}
	it can be passed on
	=
	1) don't speak evil
	2) flee from evil
	3) seek peace

{Is 11:2-3}
	the Spirit of...
		wisdom and understanding
		counsel and might
		Knowledge and FotL

{Acts 9:31}
	the Church being built up
	...walking in FotL
	...comfort of the Holy Spirit
