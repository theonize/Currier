# Matthew 20


1-16) kingdom of heaven _is like_ a master
	early morning
	hired laborers
	vineyard - representative of God's kingdom

	denarius ~= a nominal day's wage

	The first wage is representative of our faith/salvation.

6-7) Any work not in the master's vineyard is idleness.

8-10) The first may represent the Jews, who had knowledge from the Lord first and were told the wage.
  The rest may represent later kingdom believers.

14) "what belongs to you" re: Ephesians 2:8-9; we are given salvation and faith.
    It is ours only in this sense; we did not create or instantiate it.
    "take ... and go" we are given a wage to go use it- re: Matthew 25:14-30

16) this naturally flows from the last verse of chapter 19


Prophet, Priest, and King
