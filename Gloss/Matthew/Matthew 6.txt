# Matthew 6

I. True charity
II. Honest prayer
III. Eternal investment
IV. Eyesight belies devotion
  A. e.g. food & clothing
  B. The idolatry of it;  pagans crave them
  C. God's provision; the implication is that the craving should be for holiness

14-15) Does this mean God's forgiveness relies on our actions?
I don't think so: rather, God's forgiveness is a communal act that is inhibited by our mistreatment of others.


25- 34) "Therefore" - after establishing the idea of a Master Jesus expounds on the benefits of having Yahweh as a master

31) anxiety about:
	food ~ manna
	drink ~ spirit
	clothing ~ belief

32) gentiles seek these, those who don't know the Master
	Abba knows that you need them
  

33) 1st: seek Kingdom of God (free to join)
		 seek _His_ righteousness (freely given)
	all these things are added - v.31

34) Ultimately Providence teaches us that we should not borrow trouble, we are given work here and now and all else is God's domain.
