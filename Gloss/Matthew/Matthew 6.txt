# Matthew 6

I. True charity
  A. Avoid publicized piety
  B. Seek secret philanthropy
II. Honest prayer
  A. Earnest, honest, private prayer 
  B. The ordained formula for believers' prayer
    1. Who He is: heavenly and hallowed
    2. Seek God's will
    3. Seek God's provision
    4. Seek God's redemption
  C. Forgiven as you forgive
    1. Sin separates us from God but it is not what prevents us from being saved
    2. Hagioi are called to express the power of forgiveness
III. Unseen fasting
IV. Eternal investment
  A. 
V. Eyesight belies devotion
  A. The lamp shines inward
  B. The darkness is the heart of the content
  A. e.g. food & clothing
  B. The idolatry of it;  pagans crave them
  C. God's provision; the implication is that the craving should be for holiness

14-15) Does this mean God's forgiveness relies on our actions?
I don't think so: rather, God's forgiveness is a communal act that is inhibited by our mistreatment of others.


25- 34) "Therefore" - after establishing the idea of a Master Jesus expounds on the benefits of having Yahweh as a master

31) anxiety about:
	food ~ manna
	drink ~ spirit
	clothing ~ belief

32) gentiles seek these, those who don't know the Master
	Abba knows that you need them
  

33) 1st: seek Kingdom of God (free to join)
		 seek _His_ righteousness (freely given)
	all these things are added - v.31

34) Ultimately Providence teaches us that we should not borrow trouble, we are given work here and now and all else is God's domain.
