Matthew 8


10) Jesus marveled - this is something to pay attention to.


23-27) Many/most of these men were professional sailors and/or grew up on the sea, yet the storm troubled them.
       They decided to follow Jesus, who surely knew the storm was brewing, and understood Him at new depth because of the storm.


31-32)	Why did they ask?
		Why did Jesus grant it?
		...perhaps to demonstrate our capacity for evil
		[Jam 2:19]
