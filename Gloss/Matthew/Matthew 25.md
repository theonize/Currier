Matthew 25


These stories come on the heels of a discourse about the end-of-times.
These paragraphs are all we need to know about it.
They are also all Jesus knew: in his condescended state, He could not know the date (Matt 24:36) or exact circumstances beyond what is presented in Scripture.  

1-13) Ten virgins
Partial Rapture: Lot is a type of the remnant/Church whereas he _had_ to be removed before the judgment could fall

14-30) Talents were highly valuable coinage
	even the single talent was not trivial
	he gave talents based on ability/skill. 

  A talent was around 100lb...which equates to nearly a lifetime of wages for the average person.
  None of these servants ran off with the money.
  Even the "lesser" servant was given a lifetime's worth of wealth.

  Talents, in the ephemeral sense, are more than gifts: they are all the good things with which God imbued us- the essence of who we are.
  
  The master does not micromanage the servants: he leaves and expects the servants to work well.  

[Luke 19] ~ complementary, everyone gets the same amount. 
  
18) this seems like a natural, safe thing to do - but it turns out to an indefensible, punishable position


21,23) the joy of your Master
	[Zeph 3:17]
	

24-25) the man did not really know the Master- he did not also know the hit and love of the master.
  The servant's good intentions were not good enough- knowing the master is necessary.
  Not working [at all] is not acceptable.
	The servant disregards/denies the Master's claim on the talent.
	Perhaps he was hiding his connection with the Master.
	The wicked servant's talent is given the successful servant.

25) part of Jesus purpose is to divide the earthly kingdom


29) the issue is responsibility: it begins with wealth given freely to us which naturally multiplies - unless it is hidden


31-46) Sheep N Goat Judgment
	[Ez 34:17] ~ judging between two types
	traditionally the goat on the left went to Yhwh, the other went off the cliff

34) 'from the foundation of the world'
		[Heb 4:3]
		[Is 40:21]
		[Rev 17:8]
		[1Kgs 7:9]
		[Matt 25:34]
		[Luke 11:50]
	 - as opposed to -
	'before the foundation of the world'
		[Eph 1:4] ~ defining the Church
		[John 17:24] ~ high priestly prayer
		[Rev 13:8]
		[1Pet 1:20]

41) the judgment prepared for the watchers is expanded to include the "goats"
