# Matthew 5


1-12) The Beatitudes
He is teaching his disciples, in seclusion.
"up on the mountain" is somewhat unusual for an ancient person; most mountains are not readily accessible without significant technology and they were considered the abode of the gods.


2) The fact that he _opened his mouth_ to teach them implies a personal, physical Christ connection.


3-12) Each line of this poem contains a demographic descriptor and a resultant condition.
It is left to the reader to fill in the blank: what causes that type of person to achieve the mentioned status?

Who are...
- The poor in spiriit?  those who are humbly aware of their spiritual deficiency.
  - consequential rulers of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the transcendent nation occupied by God's loyal followers
- The mourners?  thos who have experienced loss.
  - these people receive comfort
- The meek?  those who control their strength; characterized by concealed power, assertiveness, kindness, mercy, and grace.
  - these receive dominion of the Earth
- The hungry & thirsty?  those whose fare is injustice.
  - these receive the satisfaction (bread & water; word & spirit) of eventual righteous governance
- The merciful?  those who do not give others the retribution they deserve, the compassionate.
  - these receive mercy
- The pure in heart?  not the natural human, but the one cleansed by God's redemption.
  - these can be present with God
- The peacemakers?  those who overlook differences and forgive wrongs against them with the goal of unity; doers of peaceful things: in response to aggression and in daily living.
  - these are known to belong to God
- Those persecuted for righteousness?  people who are punished for doing what is truly good.
  - KoH...as with the poor in spirit
- Y'all?  disciples of Christ
  - heavenly rewards
  - identity with prior saints


13) divided loyalties make a person worthless
	a rhetorical question: salt cannot become less salty, it can only be diluted, unless it is utterly destroyed (chemically or nuclearly)

	salt-rocks used for baking or meat storage would eventually be leeched of salt and lose their effectiveness

	diluted salt is thrown away because it no longer A) has flavor or B) acts as a preservative

	note: in that day pure table salt was uncommon;


14) the Church is plainly visible


15) not only is hiding a lamp ineffective...but dangerous


16) we ought to be on display ~ in such a way the God is glorified



37) Biblical support for digital communications :)



43-48) This is the illucidation of perfection: love your enemies


46) Remember who wrote the book!  Matthew is surely writing about hisself - a true humility which can only come from the Spirit


48) This is not possible under our own power!
	You must take on His righteousness [Eph 2:7-8]
