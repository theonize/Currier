Matthew 14


15-21) This the only miracle recorded in all 4 gospels


22) Why did He dismiss the crowds?  Perhaps because He knew a storm was coming.
He also dismissed Israel for a couple millenia.
The disciples were tossed upon the [sea](/pattern/sea)
...akin to the Ark
Jesus was upon the mountain praying when the storm started.
- He is currently interceding for us
- The parallel implies that He will come to us when the storm peaks.
- [Is 5:14+] 'I will go and return...'
The disciples are not out of Jesus' reach - He walked to them.


27,30) _phobeo_ ~ Jesus preemptively discluded fear.
       However, after Peter engaged in the miracle he feared.

28) A nice picture of salvation: Peter said 
1. "if it's You" ~ his idea of the Messiahs manifesting power was the ability to empower others
2. "tell me to come‚Äù ~ Peter had to step out
