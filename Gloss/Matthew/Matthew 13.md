Matthew 13

deals with subject matter not in the Old Testament
"hidden since the foundation of the world"

{Eph 3} ~ The Church

2) Interesting that He could proclaim, they could see Him, but they could not touch Him

3-9) The Sower
  4 soils, not necessarily fourths.  
 	[Is 55:11]
 	The Path
  		impenetrable, heavily trodden, scarred
  		no birth
  		no growth
  		birds ate the seed
 	Rocky Ground
  		a little soil
  		successful birth
  		immediate growth
  		withered under the sun [1Cor 3:13]
 	Thorny Ground
  		good soil
  		successful birth
  		growth
  		adjacent weeds killed them
 	Good Soil
  		successful birth
  		multiplicative growth
  		no death

9) How many have ears?  Repeated multiple times in [Rev 2-3]

10-17) The purpose of a parable
 	1. It is for the unknowing
 	2. It is for understanding
 	3. It introduces a new perception
 	4. It pricks the heart
 	5. It is a blessing

  Many such things are hidden, from individuals as well as mankind, until Good reveals them.

11) The Word is for those who have been taught it.
    Some are not taught- not everyone received the teaching of the mysteries.

12) What is this "more understanding"?
  It is more knowledge, general revelation: information; "an abundance of teaching."
How might He take away understanding?
  He will literally change our mind through natural processes.


17) re: v.11- not everyone receives the teaching.
    v.v. Daniel 12:4 ~ there is a progressive revelation as God desires.

18) Now, with some explanation of parables in general, Jesus exposits this one

19-23) Jesus shows us how to analyze a parable; note that He gives importance to many of the details in the parable - it's important to practice exegesis and gleaning rather than introduction
	General
		Soil represents a human heart

	The Path = one who hears and does not understand
		note the capability of the "evil one" to affect the transmission of Logos
	The Birds = servants of _the wicked one_
		[Jer 25]
	Rocky Ground = one who hears and immediately recieves it _with joy_
		has no root (root systems have depth and breadth)
		he _immediately_ falls away when being persecuted
		note: tribulation OR persecution; there are four different sources of trouble (your flesh, another's flesh, evil spirits)
	Thorny Ground = one who hears the word but is _unfruitful_
		cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches choke out the _fruit_
	Good Soil = one who hears the AND understands it
		bears fruit AND yields (multiplicative)
		[Heb 13:7]


34-35) He no longer spoke publically apart from parable


45-46) Pearls are
...not prized by Jews (except for their value in trade)
...the only gem made by a living organism
...created in response to an irritant
...removed from their natural habit to become and adornment
...taken out of their captivity in the [sea](/Pattern/Seas)
