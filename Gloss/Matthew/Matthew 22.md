# Matthew 22


11-13) The garment is the salvation and faith of Christ
	_speechless_
	w/o a garment (which are provided by the Master) they are cast out


23-33) Jesus quotes only from the Pentateuch - which is the only scripture that the Sadducees hold as canonical

34) The Pharisees circled their wagons (defiance)
	in v.41 He goes to them


36-40) The summation
	[Deut 6:4] ~ the first table of the law
	[Lev 19:18] ~ the second table of the law

	carrying out these things requires supernatural influence


42) The ultimate question: What do you think about the Christ?
