# Job 5

Eliphaz's Claims


1-7) Again, Eliphaz is speaking proverbial truths which seem to be generally true.
     However, he ignores (or is unaware of) the sovereignty of God allowing for black-sheep scenarios where God intervenes and the opposite is true.


8-16) Again, Eliphaz generalizes about good things happening to good people and so on.
      But, these generalizations do not prove true in human experience [in general].


17-27) Eliphaz is now explicit in claiming that God is punishing Job for some sin.
       We, however, know this is not true: God himself declares Job blameless in the first 2 chapters

27) Eliphaz claims to have "searched out" this truth: that God rewards good and punishes evil.
    But we know this to be false.
    A more succint, Biblical, retort would be: God rewards those whom He wants to and punishes those whom He wants to.

    And the audacity of Elphaz commend Job to "know it for your good" is astounding.
    The human propensity to project our limited knowledge and experience to all of others is astoundingly unhelpful.
    Imagine losing everything, including your family, and then being told by a friend that it's all your fault.
