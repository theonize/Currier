# Job 2

1-3) God was urged to oppress Job, without cause, and still Job was loyal.
As before God has set him up to be a testimony: both to the world and to Hisself.

The "Sons of God" were distinct from the angels, who are often (as in Job 38:7) represented as _stars_.


4) Skin for skin!
  There are formative events in the history of man such that we learn a new pattern of behavior.
  Adam learned humility.
  Job learned to hold a conviction to death.
  Jesus taught us charity.
  It is not always evident, even with experimental proof, that something will hold to a previous pattern.


9) Job's wife's proclamation echoes The Satan's prediction.
  Interesting how a derisive comment acknowledges that Job does, indeed, have integrity.

10) Here we have explication of Job's righteousness.
  The phrase "Job did not sin with his lips" is part & parcel with his declared righteousness; not self-declared but declared by God.
  **All** humans are sinners but Job's sin, as a doer of right things, was not counted against him [by God].

From the divine/angelic perspective, this is the end of the Act I;  Act II will be Job's ultimate response to God.
Though that second act is what sets eternity it is the intermission that is most human.
It is the in-between that is the human experience.
In a million years we may look back and struggle to remember infinitesimal life we lived on Earth I.
But I doubt it, in our perfected state we will likely remember with some fond nostalgia (and a tightness in the throat) the cascade of struggles that led us to our own Job 42:5.

11-13) Later Job's friends will have a lot to say about Job's responsibility but at least here they grieve.  That grief is more than pity, it is also a realization that the mightiest can fall and probably reminded them of their own precarious position.

11) They made "an appointment"- a plan to meet together and go to Job.
  This is not a casual drop-in: they had to exchange messages, via footmen, and make plans to meet for the visit.

13) In spite of the coming confrontational dialogs, which are harsh at times, we have the stage set where men of wealth & power come sit on the ground and keep quiet for a week to console a friend.
