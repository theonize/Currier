# Job 2

1-3) God was urged to oppress Job, without cause, and still Job was loyal.
As before God has set him up to be a testimony: both to the world and to Hisself.

The "Sons of God" were distinct from the angels, who are often (as in Job 38:7) represented as _stars_.


4) Skin for skin!
  There are formative events in the history of man such that we learn a new pattern of behavior.
  Adam learned humility.
  Job learned to hold a conviction to death.
  Jesus taught us charity.
  It is not always evident, even with experimental proof, that something will hold to a previous pattern.


9) Job's wife's proclamation echoes The Satan's prediction.
  Interesting how a derisive comment acknowledges that Job does, indeed, have integrity.

10) Here we have explication of Job's righteousness.

From the divine/angelic perspective, this is the end of the Act I;  Act II will be Job's ultimate response to God.
Though that second act is what sets eternity it is the intermission that is most human.
It is the in-between that is the human experience.
In a million years we may look back and struggle to remember infinitesimal life we lived on Earth I.
But I doubt it, in our perfected state we will likely remember with some fond nostalgia (and a tightness in the throat) the cascade of struggles that led us to our own Job 42:5.
