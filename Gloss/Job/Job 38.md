# Job 38


The first we notice hear is that God addresses Job- not any of the other men who are present.
He answers God out of the whirlwind.
Recall that Elijah, when hid away, did not hear God in wind- the large meteoric show.
Here, however, God present him awesomely.

2) "darkens counsel", also translated as "obscures plans"- as in, these mere people are hang an ornament on something they don't understand and call it a tree.
  Humans have this unflinching natural bent to identify and name something and build their life [and community] upon it.
  But we do so without knowledge- without really understanding a thing.

3) "gird up your loins" ~ when a man wore a robe and needed to run he would literally tie his belt up through the crotch and around his waist to keep the robe from tripping him up.
  This is a call to action and a challenge.
  God will lay out some of what He knows, rhetorically, and await Job's response.
