# Job 38


The first we notice hear is that God addresses Job- not any of the other men who are present.
He answers God out of the whirlwind.
Recall that Elijah, when hid away, did not hear God in wind- the large meteoric show.
Here, however, God present him awesomely.

2) "darkens counsel", also translated as "obscures plans"- as in, these mere people are hang an ornament on something they don't understand and call it a tree.
  Humans have this unflinching natural bent to identify and name something and build their life [and community] upon it.
  But we do so without knowledge- without really understanding a thing.

3) "gird up your loins" ~ when a man wore a robe and needed to run he would literally tie his belt up through the crotch and around his waist to keep the robe from tripping him up.
  This is a call to action and a challenge.
  God will lay out some of what He knows, rhetorically, and await Job's response.


4-6) God is speaking to a pre-scientific people who believed the earth was a giant snow-globe.
  His rhetoric was not to validate the ancient cosmology, but to speak to the people in a way they could understand.
  More importantly, He is making the point that only He knows the ultimate answers.

7) "morning stars" ~ morning as in first, stars as in angels.
  The _astra_ as divine beings is a trope through the Bible and many ancient religions.
  "and" implies that the angels and _Sons of God_ are distinct types of beings.
  
  There was a point when there were divine beings but no physical realm- then God created physiques and all rejoiced (and then some unrejoiced.)

8-11) The ancient person oft imagined a great wall of glass surrounding the earth, holding back the waters.
  The truth is far more magnificent- it is the nature of stuff and the governing laws that hold the water in place.
  
  The clouds as a garment is an interesting motif.
  It is the inner garment of the Earth, flowing across the surface.

  The outer garment is the darkness.
  We can only perceive to the horizon, beyond which is dark.
  Then, to the edge of the atmosphere (when lit), beyond which is dark.
