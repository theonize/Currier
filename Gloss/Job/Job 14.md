# Job 14

1-6) This expression is bourne of futility however...
     ...it is also an expression of wonder that God would condescend

7-12) A furtherance of v.5- human limits are not only age and ability but the incapacity to regenerate

13) What a deep expression: in our pride we disdain God for His brand of justice, in our humility we fear His crushing anger.
    But it was not anger that brought calamity to Job- it was a greater plan that involved hardship by a strong individual.

14) Job is expressing something we don't often relate to:
    because they believed in an intermediary stage between death and resurrection he is expressing that it would be better to just skip this life and wait quietly for the next.

15) This is really the heart of despair- if I was created then why doesn't my creator long for me?
    Am I simply a cast-off? a vestigial bit from the soup of the universe?
    The Biblical answer is no, not only is our creation intentional but careful.
    Yet, at times, God sees fit to use His strongest disciples to show His power, mercy, and grace through suffering.

16) Job recognizes that, if Yahweh is a loving father, then He would be attentive to our progression and forget our sin.
    Job sees what God said in chapters 1 & 2: he is sinful but not guilty.

17) In light of the forgiveness of Yahweh, it should be that our sins are forgotten.
    This is the only logical conclusion from the presumption that God is good.
    However, we disregard the sacrifice necessary to pay the cost of sin.
    We also don't see the larger plan God works vicariously through us.
