_Elihu_ ~ He is my God Himself

...son of...

_Barachel_ ~ that bows before God, or blesses God

Elihu the exhibitionst;
he likes to speak weightily but often without much depth or poignancy.


Elihu was the youngest of the 4 men who spoke.
He was angry and thought to defend God.

In the end Elihu does just as the others-
he mixes truths with erroneous assumptions that come from their circumstance.
