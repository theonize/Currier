# Job 16

1-5) Job admonishes his friends- not only have they not brought comforting words but they slander and insult.

5) Job is probably right, now, that he would act differently were he in their shoes.
   It is those who have suffered who offer the best comfort.

6-14) A montage of painful imagery collating internal strife with torture.
      Note the conflation of God's discipline and the wounds of "friends".
      ...gives a whole new take on "the wounds of a friend are faithful".

6) Sometimes, whether we speak or not, things do not change.

11) God hands me over "to a boy"- a phrase indicating that the inducer of suffering is one who is immature, selfish, unjust, and unwise.


15) Job is resigned to this fate, created for him.

17) He still maintains his innocenc (something which God seconds in 1:8, 2:3, 42:7-8).

18-22) Job is astonishingly persistent in his beliefs of Yahwehâ€™s deliverance.

18) Earth/blood ~ like the blood of Abel, and [Ez 24:7-8](), and [Is 26:21]().
    The blood of the innocent cries out to God for justice.
