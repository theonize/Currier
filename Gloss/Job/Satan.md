* "Satan"

Satan is a job-title more than a proper name.
As with many names in the Bible is associated with the station and circumstances of the bearer.
The word Satan means "adversary" or "accuser" and is akin to a prosecutor in modern parlance.


** In Job

The distinction in the book of Job is that we don't have __a satan__, an accuser (as in Ps 109) but __the satan__, a particular actor.


** Merit and Motive

That being said it is not explicit that this satan is the serpent of the garden, nor the diabolos/devil who tempted Jesus.
This being comes before God to give an accounting of his work and he **does the will of God**.

The reason most believers tend to import Lucifer into the role is to put some distance between the suffering of the righteous man, Job, and God.
We cannot bear (in our theology) the notions that God is directly responsible for suffering and that God excites opportunities to test his own children.
However, we must wrestle with this notion if we are to understand the book of Job.

It is not unheard of for God to meet with the fallen angels (Ps 89, Zech 3).
However, God does not rebuke this Satan.


** Fatherhood

It is a grand opportunity we have, through The Satan, to explore the fatherhood of God.
He knows better than anyone else how to shepherd and grow his children __through the ages__...and has done so.
