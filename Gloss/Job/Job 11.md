# Job 11

2-6) Zophar is, at least, intellectually honest.
     He understands that if Job is innocent, then God must be responsible for his suffering, which undermines their world-view and theology.

   This want of arcane knowledge is, oddly enough, at the heart of both witchcraft and fundamentalism.
   The former seeks power over self and others stemming from hidden knowledge, the latter...seeks the same thing.
