# Job 11

Zophar's First Response to Job


2-6) Zophar is, at least, somewhat intellectually honest.
     He understands that if Job is innocent, then God must be responsible for his suffering, which undermines their world-view and theology.

6) He assumes that b) Job has actually sinned: somehow, someway and a) there is some unknown rationalization for his suffering.
   This want of arcane knowledge is, oddly enough, at the heart of both witchcraft and fundamentalism.
   The former seeks power over self and others stemming from hidden knowledge, the latter...seeks the same thing.

7-9) This is a terrific presentation of the general revelation of God.
     However, the caveat is that God reveals Hisself to us- what He wants us to know of Him we know.

10-12) Ad naseum we encounter the same paradigm: God **can** punish the wicked whenever He chooses, but:
       we are all wicked,
       and it may not be most efficacious for His master plan- which is to save as many humans as possible throughout time.

12) Calling another human being stupid for not sharing your interpretation of God is not a good idea.
    History is replete with examples of sudden destruction, of fools shaming the wise and the weak shaming the strong.

13-18) Zophar contends that a "righteous act" on the part of Job will relieve his suffering.

13-14) The notion that piety and justice are the key to joy and is dangerous-
       God is not obligated to do "right" by us.

15) We are indeed firmly established and unafraid in God's care but it not because of our actions.
    Our righteousness, by which God judges us, is a gift from God.
    We shan't "hold our heads high"- this is genesis of pride [Is 14](../Isaiah/Isaiah%2014.md)
    And fault is never far from us- it is the guilt which is gone through Christ.

16-18) These are all valid promises of God, but not necessarily fulfilled in this life.

19) This promise of earthly security is both fleeting and vapid.
    It is a promise that is not necessarily fulfilled in this life, but in the next.

20) The wicked do not always suffer here-and-now, certainly not at our behest.
    However, for them, this life is the best they will ever have.
    For the believer, this life is the worst we will ever have.
    This is true no matter how good this life is for us.
