# Job 27


2-6) The conscience is a powerful thing.
     In a sense the medium of the will, the mental apparatus that allows direction of willpower.
     This is why people are so implaccable when challenged at their core beliefs.
     An innate belief (or ability) enacts faster than rational thought.
     This is why fundmanetal changes can only be had by slathering the truth and divine intervention.
     A foundational change requires the original creator.

7-10) The most apropos explanation of the non-believer's plight:
      Those apart from God are there willingly and one of the consequences of being in that place is lacking God's help & comfort.

11) Perhaps Job thinks he is teaching us through his words of wisdom-
    really he is teaching us through a vast, deliterious object lesson.

    He could not conceal God's plan is He wanted to.
    On of the things we fail to realize is that we are all in God's plan and it is unfolding as we go.
    It is not so much that God hides his plans, we just don't have the capacity to see the whole thing;
    thus, we assume there isn't one- and God couldn't show us anyway because its outside our capacity to comprehend.

12) They continue to talk, of course, because that's all they know to do.
    Some people have something to say and some people have to say something.
