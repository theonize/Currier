# Job 42


We have, in Christianity, several pattern prayers:
- Lord's prayer
- ACTS (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication)
- 5 finger prayer

...and so on, but this is one that deserves more usage.
In a time before Christ, even before written scriptures, Job quotes God [twice] and answers truthfully.
It's easy to admonish Job for spiraling down toward disbelief and self-loathing but, never forget, God did not depart.
God was present through the entire discourse of the five men.
1. We do not, and cannot, understand God's ways
2. In the struggle we see God

If it were so that we could learn things previously unlearned and, thus, come closer to God; then it would also be so that those who had not yet learned these things would not understand them.
It is only through the continual, graceful, influence of God that we progress in our understanding of Him and His creation.




5-6) This is the point of Job's suffering: that we, and everyone who reads it, will come to this point where they can stand with God.

6) "in dust & ashes" the man is, essentially, dust- and the only difference between us and natural stuff is the divine spark from God.


God's Rebuke

- Eliphaz is singled out as the head of the cabal
- Job becomes the intercessor
- The friends are required to sacrifice
- God announces:
  - The friends have not spoken rightly
  - Job has spoken rightly
- Elihu does not seem to be included in this rebuke
  - If Elihu was included it was vicariously through the admonition of his elders

The three friends, fully named (not a name change), did as they were told and God did as He promised.


Fortune

We misconstrue fortune as wealth, health, or happiness.
In reality fortune is the providential opportunity to achieve those things.
It is the non-atheist version of luck- humans make luck, God makes fortune.
It is said, in English, that a person "gain/list a fortune"- this speaks more to acting upon, or squandering, the oppotunity.

What is made clear is that God gives the fortunes [plural] and doubly so, relative to before the loss.
The numbers of livestock are strictly doubled.
However, the number of children is the same as before: God considers the ten previous children as still alive and we have inherited this paradigm.
Job had 20 children, all differing lifespans.

Job was certainly long-lived by any measure: at a minimum he had 1 child per year for 20 years (minus the tribulation period.)
Even if some children were concubinal, it is still a considerable span of time.
Not to mention that herds and workers don't spring up overnight.


11) Job's extended family comes to sup with him.
  This is a sign of restoration.
  We also see that Job did not lose everything he had- he was able to give his members money.
  This may be the investment by which he restarted his empire.
  
  It is also made clear here that it was Yahweh was the one who is accountable for Job's calamity and grief.
  To narrow a view of God will fail when trying to reconcile His goodness with His discipline- especially when it causes hardship and death.
  The crux of Job's story is that God cannot answer the question of suffering and death for us.
  It is not that He cannot provide an answer, but that we cannot grasp it.
  As our spiritual maturity increases so does our understanding of God's ways (though they are still far beyond us.)
  Thus, comes a natural divide between ourselves and those who understand less because they have not yet learned.
  However, though it becomes difficult to share it is not (as God proves by speaking to us) impossible.
  If the book of Job tells us anything it is that the story must be told- God's redemption is real and freely available and it is accessible for people at every level.
