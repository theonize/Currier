# Job 42


We have, in Christianity, several pattern prayers:
- Lord's prayer
- ACTS (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication)
- 5 finger prayer

...and so on, but this is one that deserves more usage.
In a time before Christ, even before written scriptures, Job quotes God [twice] and answers truthfully.
It's easy to admonish Job for spiraling down toward disbelief and self-loathing but, never forget, God did not depart.
God was present through the entire discourse of the five men.
1. We do not, and cannot, understand God's ways
2. In the struggle we see God

If it were so that we could learn things previously unlearned and, thus, come closer to God; then it would also be so that those who had not yet learned these things would not understand them.
It is only through the continual, graceful, influence of God that we progress in our understanding of Him and His creation.




5-6) This is the point of Job's suffering: that we, and everyone who reads it, will come to this point where they can stand with God.

6) "in dust & ashes" the man is, essentially, dust- and the only difference between us and natural stuff is the divine spark from God.


God's Rebuke

- Eliphaz is singled out as the head of the cabal
- Job becomes the intercessor
- The friends are required to sacrifice
- God announces:
  - The friends have not spoken rightly
  - Job has spoken rightly

The three friends, fully named (not a name change), did as they were told and God did as He promised.
