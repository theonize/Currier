# Job 33

1-7) Elihu is, figuratively, a young prick.
     He tries to present a glossy, polished veneer over wet clay; 
     Simultaneously, he presumes to educate and admonish the older man.

2-3) Belittling an audience is the surest way to no be heard.
     But, even if the audience were mature enough to not only listen but also digest what was said:
     The message is still in jeopardy coming from an isolent mouth.

4-6) This self-espousing argument is not only off-putting from contradictory-
     if we are all made alike then how can his words be new and wisdom laden?
     Further, if wisdom is given rather than earned (and perhaps it is botth), that still gives more credence to the older because they had more chance to receive.
     So, the implication here is the Job has been closed to wisdom all these years and the young master will come and make up the difference.

7) "Fear of me have not" ~ at this point in the story I cannot imagine Job having anything but annoyance for Elihu.

8-11) Elihu illuminates an important point here:
      The are conflating tribulation with enmity.
      **It is not only enemies of God who suffer**.
      Paul, and others, understood this as they were willing to suffer so that others might meet God and be saved.

12-33) However, Elihu isn't making this point.
       He states that we have no right to question God-
       which is, incidentally, not forbidden.
       Though we cannot know God's _why_ we certainly know His _how_ and _what_ because we live it!
       These four accomplices are towing the line of being gods to God because their actions sway Him one way or another.

12-16) This is a poetic indulgence of the ideal in [Romans 1]()-
       that God has given creation as a sign and there is no excuse for not knowing Him.

17) ...however, God is not in the business of changing behaviors and attitudes [directly]:
    He saves and remodels us, changes of will and outcome are secondary.
    It is not precisely true that God suppresses pride:  He certainly humiliates (even undergoing humiliation Himself) but this does not cloister or move pride aside- it eradicates it.

18-22) As with so much in this book there is a blanket truth here over an empty frame:
       Trial is disciplinary, but discipline is not punitive.
       God disciplines His children **rathen than** seeking justice.
       Either may be harsh but the former comes to an end while the latter is but a prelude of the ultime separation from God.

23-30) There is a very important truth here: God does not save us only to have us but that our testimony of salvation might save others.
       There is no distinction or delineation between God's gospel and our life's testimony- they are the same work, worked for the salvation of as many as possible.

31-33) Elihu's is escalating the interference of the other friends.
       "If you're quiet then I won't be" is the clarion call of the brash exhort.
       Silence is no more an invitation to speak than an open door is an invitation to enter.
       Given the opportunity to speak, Elihu firmly infractures his 
       metatarsus in his pie-hole.

33) "be quiet and I will teach you wisdom" ~ is an arrogant untruth which is espoused by those who want to be head of the class.
    Wisdom is imparted through teaching of a different sort- work.
    The words used for wisdom relate to skill, cleverness, shrewdness, and administration;
    as opposed to study, research, rumination, or meditation.
