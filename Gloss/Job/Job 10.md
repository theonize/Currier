# Job 10

1-7) Job is growing more bitter- he is calling on God to prove His sovereignty.
     It is important that he is re-framing his understanding of God based on God's omnipotence and omniscience- if there is suffering it cannot be outside of God's purview.

1) Disgust- not a unique sentiment and a necessary precursor to being able to voice complaints;
   If we are happy and afraid to lose our stuff we don't tend to rock the boat.

3) It depends how we define "good".
   If goodness is what makes me happy right now then, no, suffering is not good;
   But if good is whatever brings as many people as possible to God, then I cannot determine what is good.

4-5) Point of fact: God does have human fles...even in the old testament (Abraham, Joshua, and Gideon witnessed it (among others.))
     However, God is not limited by a human body

6) ...and He uses a human body to condescend so that we may know Him- not so He might belittle us.

7) "You know that I am not wicked" - again we require a definition: what is wickedness?
   Wickedness cannot be any evil thing done ever, but whether or not that wickedness is prosecutable.
   Luckily, there is a scenario where our evil acts are sealed and not charged against us.
