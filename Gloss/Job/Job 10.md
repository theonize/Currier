# Job 10

1-7) Job is growing more bitter- he is calling on God to prove His sovereignty.
     It is important that he is re-framing his understanding of God based on God's omnipotence and omniscience- if there is suffering it cannot be outside of God's purview.

1) Disgust- not a unique sentiment and a necessary precursor to being able to voice complaints;
   If we are happy and afraid to lose our stuff we don't tend to rock the boat.

3) It depends how we define "good".
   If goodness is what makes me happy right now then, no, suffering is not good;
   But if good is whatever brings as many people as possible to God, then I cannot determine what is good.

4-5) Point of fact: God does have human fles...even in the old testament (Abraham, Joshua, and Gideon witnessed it (among others.))
     However, God is not limited by a human body

6) ...and He uses a human body to condescend so that we may know Him- not so He might belittle us.

7) "You know that I am not wicked" - again we require a definition: what is wickedness?
   Wickedness cannot be any evil thing done ever, but whether or not that wickedness is prosecutable.
   Luckily, there is a scenario where our evil acts are sealed and not charged against us.


8-12) Job has reconciled that God's creation must not be futile- he bases this on his experience of God and his spiritual instinct from being a Yahwist.

11) Probably precursive to Psalm 139:16; many of Job's refrains are part of pre-Jewish tradition.

12) Even crummy life is still life

13-17) Job is recognizing both God's omniscience and His war against sinfulness.
       As such Job sees that God does not respond to human sin with immediate destruction...or else we all have been destroyed long ago.
       The "hidden plan" of God is something merely out of our understanding-
       it is not a __secret__ in that its revelation would produce a great risk but more like a general having a grand battle strategy where explaining it to the footsoldiers would be exhaustive;
       it is beyond our capacity and what we need to know He has already revealed.

14-15a) God does not wink at sin- He is not indifferent to it.
        He is not indifferent to the suffering of the misled either- He forgives and forgets the transgressions of the penitent.

15b) "righteous" is, Biblically, bestowed- we are __made__ right by God not of our own.
     Righteousness is not a magic power but a symptom of belonging to God.
     Jesus likened it to a wage having been paid: it is ours once given and we can spend it however we choose.
     In Job's case he is stretched beyond what his wage can cover.

16) Peter uses this same analogy [1 Peter 5:8]() to describe the machinations of another divine being.
    We are tempted to equate Job's suffering with pride but this is not valid- God Hisself declared Job righteous in chapters 1 & 2.

17) You "bring fresh troops" against me!
    This was literally true for Job- the Sabeans, the Chaldeans, the fire from heaven, and the windstorm.
   
18-22) Job is lamenting his situation

20) This is such an honest sentiment.
    And I think that God does relent at times to allow our recomposure- waiting for us to say "Uncle!".

21-22) All metaphors have a basis in truth- what is the source of this knowledge?
       Considering that Job was, most likely, a contemporary of Abraham (or thereabouts) they had a deep understanding of this separative state of the dead.
       The "deep darkness" refers to more than just absence of light, it is also a darkness of the mind and soul.
       We often fail to appreciate that God pours life energy into this universe.
       With Him is creation and hope, without Him is entropy and despair.
       The Biblical view is that all humans are eternal- God grants us the choice to be with Him or not during eternity.
       So, there must be sustenance of some kind for those separated from God- just enough light to exist by...
