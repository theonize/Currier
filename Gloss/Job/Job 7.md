# Job 7

1-5) It is useful, even for the posh, to acknowledge the drudgery of life.
     Job adds details about his health condition: his body is covered with sores and rot and scars.

6-10) Job recognizes the futility and finality that humans experience: these are things that the rich do experience but get glossed over because of the anesthetic quality of opulence.


11-16) Job's response to suffering is not resignation- it is complaint and petition directed at God.

12) He has the notion that the sea, and it's divine quality, are restrained by God's will.
    The sea, and the gods thereof, are placed and contained by natural laws.

13) Note that Job retained his own house (his own bed)- he was not completely destitute.

14) The most terrifyin feature of nightmares is where they overlap and conincide with reality.

15-16) Again, he longs for death but will not bring it on hisself.


17-21) A valid line of thought that we should all explore: why is God at all interested in us?

21) Job acknowledges both his own sin and blamelessness.
    He is recognizing God's sovereign ability to forgive.
