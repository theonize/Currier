# Job 21

Job replies

2-3) Job is implying that they appear to simply desire comeuppance.
     So, he will continue at his path and they at theirs.

4) Excellent questions...if God is truly AlMighty then why do we expect so little of Him?
   Many humans anthropomorphize and alienize God to the point of disbelief and their own detriment.

5-6) Job's condition is detestible- he has become a sort of wraith.
     ...a shadow of a human in a mangled husk of God's design.

6) This is a classic kind of hebrew/jewish segue.
   It meshes with the prior and afore thoughts which aren't otherwise connected.

7-16) This is a direct refutation of everything the "friends" have been saying.
      As if, "Look!  The wicked live right down the street.  There are his kids playing in the field."

15) This is a sad state to be in: to doubt one's own purpose and place.
    Intellectually, we can know that Providence alone gave us what we have and put us where we are.
    However, our heart and gut tell us otherwise- they wonder the worth of efforts.
    In truth, we must balance all three levels.
    When our heart's fail we can rationalize.
    When reason fails we have experience.
    When we are worn we have willpower to fall on.
    This is the great trap of Bildad, Elihu, and Zophar: they lean on some element of their self and build a world-view to help prop it up.

16) This is a hard concept to come to terms with: God is accountable for the properity of the wicked.
    He is also accountable for the suffering of the righteous.
    The wisdom literature and narratives of scripture tell us that righteousness __tends__ towards prosperity and wickedness __tends__ towards loss.
    But, this is not always the case- it is often not the case (often enough that we have all experienced it.)
    And saying that God is accountable means that He made it happen.
    It is not for nothing, but it is His design.

17-21) Job finally answers the question of the prosperity of the wicked.
       Part of the issue in the theological volume is that they are teasing apart issues of cult & faith that need to be examined in depth and in part.

19) This is often true that we inherit debts from our parents- financial, spiritual, and emotional.

22-26) It is not as if God is unaware of the travails of various humans.
       We are the ones who desparately try to make sense of circumstances and largely fail to do so;
       because we cannot see the entire canvas.

27-34) What was an abstract argument about righteous equating the prosperity of varying degrees is now very real to Job.
       Naturally, he takes umbrage with their continual denouncements because **by their own reckoning** he should be prosperous & healthy.

34) The true deception here is propping up a worldview that has brought wealth and honor to certain people.
    However, because God is not primarily interested in the wealth and honor of those outside His house this doesn't factor in.
    God doesn't consider His household to be premier among many- it is the only one He considers.
    The other skim off the overflow.
