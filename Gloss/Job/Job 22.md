# Job 22


2-3) This is a deep question akin to: Can God learn?  Can God attain?
     The answer is, generally, no.
     However, God created free beings and He has __obtained__ a lasting relationship with many of us.
     There are such relationships (that is, with humans) that He will never have.
     There are also relationships He has lost and will never regain.

4) The question of the day: is God punishing the righteous?
   The simple answer is no; the deeper answer is that God allows the suffering of the righteous as a testimony of His ability to relate to and influence man.
   The truest power of God is that His revelation to man is so impactful that humans who are so enlightened can bear up under any temptation and deal with suffering unto death.
