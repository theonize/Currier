# Job 22


2-3) This is a deep question akin to: Can God learn?  Can God attain?
     The answer is, generally, no.
     However, God created free beings and He has __obtained__ a lasting relationship with many of us.
     There are such relationships (that is, with humans) that He will never have.
     There are also relationships He has lost and will never regain.

4) The question of the day: is God punishing the righteous?
   The simple answer is no; the deeper answer is that God allows the suffering of the righteous as a testimony of His ability to relate to and influence man.
   The truest power of God is that His revelation to man is so impactful that humans who are so enlightened can bear up under any temptation and deal with suffering unto death.

5) This is somewhat true- Eliphaz is describing the depravity of men.
   However, God Hisself declared Job righteous which means the "endless" iniquity has ceased.
   The issue is not the sin, but the willfulness of it.

6-9) I wonder if these are true or if Eliphaz is speculating/assuming.
     Perhaps Job did cross many people.
     But, we have to consider that:
     - it may have been a phase of his life that he grew out of
     - or these things were misconstrued by people who don't know what compromises and limitations this powerful man had

10-11) Eliphaz seems to be projecting his fear onto Job because he isn't really describing Job's state.
       Based on the narrative and Job's words he is not buried or smothered but, rather, adrift/cut-off.

12-14) Eliphaz is extrapolating, incorrectly, about Job's perception.
       Job is not focused on judgment, as are his friends, but, rather, understanding.
       Why? is a legitimate grievance, the answer to which reveals the character of the judge.
       Job does not understand and is seeking to.
       The Three are applying their current level of understanding and trying to fit things to it.

15-20) The Three must hold the line on this: that God always punishes the wicked on Earth.
       Otherwise, their worldview is demolished.
       Eliphaz is self-effacing here and doesn't see it while trying to be dominant:
       The wicked were destroyed by God, after God enriched them, and the righteous triumph.
       Whether the wicked rise or fall on Earth is entirely up to God, as with the righteous.

21-25) This is, in modern parlance, the "prosperity gospel".
       The idea that God enriches/heals those who repent and love Him [on Earth] is heresy.
       It is (obviously) and ancient idea that has no historical proof.
       But the heretical idea is that we can control God by our actions.
       It is the transubstantiation of the soul:
       the notion that our novel behavior is what influences God to do "right".
       God does as He will.
       What is truly, eternally, right is beyond our comprehension.

24-25) This is the best advice Eliphaz has given...right on the heels of the worst.
       The Bible does not prescribe the abolition of material wealth;
       but it does condone such a spirit.
       We ought to know that things are vanishingly valueless in light of God's immense value.

26) If the only time you delight in God is when He materially blesses you then the foundation of that relationship is thin indeed.
    We must understand that our circumstances are deliberately tuned by God.
    The naive understand this in terms of self; the wise understand this in terms of humanity.
    We ought to do this thing Eliphaz describes not for ourselves because God has blessed us but for the good of others because we are His children.

27-30) As if God only hears the prayers of the pious and wealthy?
       God truly hears __everything__ but we conflate "hearing" with "doing".
       God is never beholden to answer our prayers in the way we desire.
       However, we know that God does at times do so.
       The question being, is God more likely to answer a prayer to save the humiliated and rescue to the shamed or to give me money or healing?
       There are a thousand reasons from character-building to entrapment that dissuade God from granting wealth and health.
       There are far fewer reasons for God to press against the pitiful seeker.

27) This idea that we resond to God's blessing with goodness is actually quite true but fraught with difficulty.
    It is a natural human response to an unexpected or lavish gift to be grateful and happy.
    But our goodness should not be contingent on God's blessing.
    You should fulfill your vows no matter what (and not make vows you can't keep.)

30b) A triumphal, blunderous end to this mish-mash of truth and heresy:
     It is semantically and theologically correct to say that __some__ are rescued by our "pure hands".
     But it is God that cleaned them, God that led us to the graveyard, and God who revealed the damned to us.
     This is such a strange bit of the whole to elevate.
     Our own righteousness, which is God-given, should not be focus of anything.
     If anything it is a lens brining God into better focus.
