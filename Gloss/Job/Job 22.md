# Job 22


2-3) This is a deep question akin to: Can God learn?  Can God attain?
     The answer is, generally, no.
     However, God created free beings and He has __obtained__ a lasting relationship with many of us.
     There are such relationships (that is, with humans) that He will never have.
     There are also relationships He has lost and will never regain.
