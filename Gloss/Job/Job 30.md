# Job 30

1-8) Job is now in a lower state than even the poorest, roughest souls in his commmunity.
     The ones who, proverbially, dig through the trash for food: the scrub bushes and weeds.

8) There is, perhaps, a glimmer of the sense of Providence here in recognizing the uncouth were driven out.
   Whether by force of arms or force of nature God tends to move peoples where He pleases.

9-15) Certainly Job's initial fall from grace was literally a battle against him.
      But now, even at this low point, he is experiencing the disdain of others who are jealous of __what he was__.

9) These same, worthless men who Job would not emply are now his social superiors.

10) The consequent distancing and spitting are an indication of the vice of pride [of the worthless men].

11) "loosening the bowstring" is a metaphor for the loss of strength and power.
    Job [again] recognizes that it is God who has brought him low.

12) The "rabble" or obscure peoples are now at hand: entrapping and working destruction against Job.

14-15) A terrible place to be: in the midst of a ruined life the dark workers cannot help but press until you don't even have the rubble to house you.

15) "like a cloud" it is certainly true, with voluminous historical data, that God can dismiss the power of the powerful and the wealth of the wealthy in an instant.
    He has never shied from showing His power mightily.
    We don't see it because we choose not to follow His plan-
    I mean this not in the way of day-to-day works but in the way of a fan watching their hero do an amazing thing on the field.
