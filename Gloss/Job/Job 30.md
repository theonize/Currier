# Job 30

1-8) Job is now in a lower state than even the poorest, roughest souls in his commmunity.
     The ones who, proverbially, dig through the trash for food: the scrub bushes and weeds.

8) There is, perhaps, a glimmer of the sense of Providence here in recognizing the uncouth were driven out.
   Whether by force of arms or force of nature God tends to move peoples where He pleases.
