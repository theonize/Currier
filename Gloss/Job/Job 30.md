# Job 30

1-8) Job is now in a lower state than even the poorest, roughest souls in his commmunity.
     The ones who, proverbially, dig through the trash for food: the scrub bushes and weeds.

8) There is, perhaps, a glimmer of the sense of Providence here in recognizing the uncouth were driven out.
   Whether by force of arms or force of nature God tends to move peoples where He pleases.

9-15) Certainly Job's initial fall from grace was literally a battle against him.
      But now, even at this low point, he is experiencing the disdain of others who are jealous of __what he was__.

9) These same, worthless men who Job would not emply are now his social superiors.

10) The consequent distancing and spitting are an indication of the vice of pride [of the worthless men].

11) "loosening the bowstring" is a metaphor for the loss of strength and power.
    Job [again] recognizes that it is God who has brought him low.

12) The "rabble" or obscure peoples are now at hand: entrapping and working destruction against Job.

14-15) A terrible place to be: in the midst of a ruined life the dark workers cannot help but press until you don't even have the rubble to house you.

15) "like a cloud" it is certainly true, with voluminous historical data, that God can dismiss the power of the powerful and the wealth of the wealthy in an instant.
    He has never shied from showing His power mightily.
    We don't see it because we choose not to follow His plan-
    I mean this not in the way of day-to-day works but in the way of a fan watching their hero do an amazing thing on the field.

16-19) This may be the most poignant description of authoritarian misery ever.

16) The "life poured out before me" nods in two directions: 
    1. the way in which calamity forces us toe step back and look at the whole
    2. the nature of "me" such that "I" can disassociate from this earthly life

    Being __seized__ by days of affliction is that state where the whole of your mind is occupied by whatever pain or need is present- there is no room for all those nostalgic niceties he lamented in the previous chapter.

17) Something about being exhausted by emotional and mental pain makes us unable to deal with intrusive thoughts when we lay down to relax for sleep...too tired to sleep.

18-19) Disheveled- the image [for me] is a drill instructor grabbing the probationary by the scruff of the neck and shoving them into the freezing mud.
       ...knowing that, in order to become an effective soldier, they must endure this trial.
       Who knows what amazing things Job did after his remodeling- but it is dwarfed by this written testimony read by a billion people over the millenia.

20-23) Job is circling the true nature of God but still misses in one key area: God is not cruel.
       Harshness, terseness, and aloofness are not cruel when they come from Yahweh.
       In fact, Job will come to know that these separations are **given** to us by God to help us grow.

22) This is the entire story in a nutshell, "You lift me up and make me ride the storm."


24-31) There no one to help Job and his distress is growing.
       He is not alone but his companions are ruthless hunters, skittish fowl, and pain.
       The instruments that could bring joy now bring only sorrow.


29) Jackals are shrewd pack-hunters.
    The ostrich, nearly extinct in Arabia now, is liable to hurt their chicks when escaping.
    They often hatch only some of their eggs and use the others as food for the chicks.

31) Job's musical instruments once produced joyous sounds, not they produce melancholy and mourning.
    The harp is a symbol of joy and the flute is a symbol of peace.
    The joy and peace are gone from Job's life.
    But there is an element of this quip where Job's breadth of experience has increased- his instruments knew only a wavelength, now they know the whole spectrum.
