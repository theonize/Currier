# Job 32

Elihu thinks he will defend God.
He is angry about the discussion up til now.
He perceives that he has the answer and will now speak for God...from his heart & mind.


3) The reason for his anger was that they failed to refute Job.
   SPOILER ALERT: Elihu will also fail at this.

6) Twice we get his full name with lineage: the one of God, son of him who bows before God, of the despised.
   Elihu is pious for God's sake, but not because of nearness to God- as is God's design.

6-9) True that the young have knowledge and some are given wisdom.
     However, wisdom is not proved without trial, and trial takes time.
     Hence, the many reflections in proverbs [and elsewhere] about the importance of gray hair.

8) This is an interesting outcome of a relationship with Christ:
   the Holy Spirit teaches us, imparting knowledge and wisdom supernaturally [1 John 2:27]().
   That is not to say that we don't work for it or that it may not come through others.
   Much the same way scripture itself was inspired yet came from deliberate, conscious human work.
   Additionally, the same way the scripture _is_ inspired when copied and recited, our personal inspiration lingers.

12b) This is the crux of Elihu's bluster:
     That there must be a culmination to this argument; i.e. they need to figure it out.

13) "Let God deal with him" may well be the brightest thing any of them could do.
    All five should return to the ashes...but then we wouldn't have such and interesting epic.

14) He notes the wise, old, stricken man has not engaged him.
    Further, Elihu has no need of the friends arguments because they obviously lack.

15-17) Elihu's entire prologue is like the pummeling of an enthusiastic steamroller that won't wait for road materials to be dropped first.
       Young leaders are the premier assumers, and assumptions without basis of experience are the most dangerous.
