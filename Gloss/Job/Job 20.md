# Job 20

Zophar replies to Job

2-3) He is, understandably, upset.
     Remember that they are encroaching on a line of thought that is new to them and, likely, new in history.
     Note that Zophar begins with his own understanding...

4-11) In thinking of the briefness of the wicked- it is no more or less than that of the righteous.
      Everything he says is true from an eternal perspective: all humans die.
      However, the wicked do not always suffer in this life.
      Zophar emmends that the wicked, at times, attain great heights.
      At what point to we presume that God should strike them __in this life__?
      For that matter, what is the difference [in heart] between me and those who are "known" to be wicked?  ...not much...

12-22) This is a true treatise about why to avoid wicked gain: it devours a person from the inside out.
       Unjust gain is a poison that destroys the person who has it.


23+) Alas, Zophar continues firmly in his trope- that God will __surely__ punish the wicked __on Earth__.

24) The knowledge of iron weapons was fairly advanced for the time of Abraham (see notes of ch.19:25).
    Furthermore, he mentions the bronze bwo- this is a ridiculous item for thought-experimentation only but the knowledge of bronze pulls the story into the future.  
    For example, we have mention of the Philistines military advantage, in Judges, because of their iron chariots.
    Obviously, the knowledge pre-dates the manufacture but it indicates a relative position of the book in history- late patriarchal to early judges.

24-29) A poignant reprise of the wickeds' fate.
       When our mortality comes to the forefront we tend to honestly examine our situation.
