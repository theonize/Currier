# Job 20

Zophar replies to Job

2-3) He is, understandably, upset.
     Remember that they are encroaching on a line of thought that is new to them and, likely, new in history.
     Note that Zophar begins with his own understanding...

4-11) In thinking of the briefness of the wicked- it is no more or less than that of the righteous.
      Everything he says is true from an eternal perspective: all humans die.
      However, the wicked do not always suffer in this life.
      Zophar emmends that the wicked, at times, attain great heights.
      At what point to we presume that God should strike them __in this life__?
      For that matter, what is the difference [in heart] between me and those who are "known" to be wicked?  ...not much...
