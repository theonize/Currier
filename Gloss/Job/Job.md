# Job

When was Job?
	Genesis 46:13 mentions a Job, son of Issachar
		this would mean Job was born after Joseph's sale and moved back to Midian after the migration

Job wasn't sinless, but he was blameless


What is the nature, and role, of divinity in our lives?
- God's sovreignty
- Angels' province
- Mans' dominion


Eliphaz the Eloquent ~ experience is king
Bildad the Brutal ~ traditionalist
Zophar the Zealous ~ piety rules

There are three types of politics, which are evidenced in the three friends:
* populist ~ prioritizes people and their morality
* traditionalist ~ prioritizes the system
* zealot ~ prioritizes the ideal of liberty in light of perceived rights


Two kinds of people:
	those that have something to say
	those that have to say something

The friends:
* never offer prayers, only Job prays
* argue theology w/ Job
* incorrectly diagnose Job's condition & circumstances
* offer truths that are not applicable or helpful
* are harsh


Dating Job:
  
	Historically, the events of Job could be anywhere between Abraham and the end of Judges.
The book may mention creatures that are extinct, which would push the date back.
However, the mention of "leaded tablets" and iron weapons/tools brings the date forward.
Although, these could simply indicate Job's erudition in the latest-and-greatest technology of the day.
There is no known extra-Biblical reference to the man of Job.
This tends to support an earlier date for the events because others' history thins considerably as you precede in time.
Theologically the date is not significant.
	
	It is not a massive problem to make Job and friends a pure allegory, especially in light of the divine council scene in the prologue (of which Job had no knowledge.)
However, the Bible does not typically name people and places in parable- name denote important people and places.
There are many instances in history where Biblical stories were thought to be unreal only to have archaeology later prove them true.


Culture:
	Much of Job's language is echoed in the Psalms.
	Though this could indicate a late date of writing the technological mentions in the book cast some doubt on a late date.
	It is more likely that the traditions and cult which became codified as the Jewish faith were already in place by the time of Job's life.
	This is evident in his sacrificial practices which include remission of sin and a familial orientation.
