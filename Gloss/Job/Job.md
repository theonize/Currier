# Job

When was Job?
	Genesis 46:13 mentions a Job, son of Issachar
		this would mean Job was born after Joseph's sale and moved back to Midian after the migration

Job wasn't sinless, but he was blameless


What is the nature, and role, of divinity in our lives?
- God's sovreignty
- Angels' province
- Mans' dominion


Eliphaz the Eloquent ~ experience is king
Bildad the Brutal ~ traditionalist
Zophar the Zealous ~ 

There are three types of politics, which are evidenced in the three friends:
* populist ~ prioritizes people and their morality
* traditionalist ~ prioritizes the system
* zealot ~ prioritizes the ideal and liberty in light of perceived rights


Two kinds of people:
	those that have something to say
	those that have to say something

The friends:
* never offer prayers, only Job prays
* argue theology w/ Job
* incorrectly diagnose Job's condition & circumstances
* offer truths that are not applicable or helpful
* are harsh
