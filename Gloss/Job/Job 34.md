# Job 34


Elihu continues... <sigh> ...need it be said that characters in scripture evoke such memorability in us?

2-9) Elihu continues to base his assumptions;
     from the outside we can see the flaws:
     - God Himself declared Job righteous, not vice versa
     - he seems to make several extensions and extrapolations that are either unfounded or out of Job's control

2) "Hear ye, hear me" ~ the young man demanding to be heard hearkens to toddlerhood.
   As if adding "o, knowledgable ones" makes it more palatable.
   Suffice to say that ending a phrase with a compliment tends to be more unhanded than a leading one.

3) This is pedantically obvious but also biologically essential:
   theere are mechanisms that intercede in neural pathways to perform low-level tasks.
   In this case, shying away from danger and gagging.

4) "Let us decide together what is good."  No thank you.
   Mayhaps, let us receive our morality from an authority.

5-6) There are two things wrong with the justice perspective of all the characters:
     1. God is not beholden to our sense of right and wrong, nor is He required to maintain some unwritten code familiar to us.
     2. The _wounding_ is not incurable- God can cure any ill, any time, as He pleases.

7-9) "for he has said" ~ Elihu makes a classic political manuever here (because his philological one cannot hold its own weight):
     he is conflating the Job's predicament with some quip of his as if Job had the power to create these circumstances.
     Job did not willing give up his estate, it was taken from him.
     In chapter 21 Job is positing that a life with God does not equate to material gain.
     Elihu is implying that Job does not see value in a relationship with God.
     Another interpretation is needed...but we won't get it from Elihu.
     God's people, as a whole, will undergo a Jobian experience in Egypt for generations...
