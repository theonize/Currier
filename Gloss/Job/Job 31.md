# Job 31


This is the chapter where Job really begins to break the connection between his suffering and lack of, or evil, works.
Where, previously, he was adamant that he was undeserving of any punishment.
Now we see the shift to understanding that this suffering is not about justice.


1-4) This passage may preclude the polygamy of Job,
     or it could just be a general statement of fidelity.
     Concubines were not unholy or unclean.
     Prostitutes were unclean but not culturally uncouth.
     However, taking another's bride (or potential bride) was very bad.

5-8) Job recognizes that there must be some basis for righteousness-
     you can't just declare it, you have to _have_ it.
     What he hasn't quite connected is that God gives righteousness, it is not attained by works.

     Point of fact: God is not judging Job, nor does He make any proclamation per Job's integrity.
     Neither has God redacted Job's stuff punitively- He has another purpose.
     SPOILER ALERT: that purpose is you and I (and billions more) partaking of the story.

9-12) Job's wife is still around- her presence is consequential as it signals to us that Job is honest.
      God does not long tolerate those who despise their wives.
      Wives do not long tolerate those who do nothing for them.
      - recall that she admonished Job to either die or move on because (at least partly) she needed him to.

13-15) The plea of good master is a powerful one:
       Holding a servants livelihood in your hand is not a light duty.
       It is not just the work or the servant's life at stake but their entire family.

15) The recognition of the humanity of all classes of people is not the natural state for human's.
    We have __ALWAYS__ created social division and hierarchies.
    This is a profoundly enlightening perspective for that time.
