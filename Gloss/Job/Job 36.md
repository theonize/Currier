# Job 36

2-4)
  This short paragraph charicaturizes Elihu like no other.
  He presumes to speak on God's behalf, yet doesn't speak the word of God.
  He simply talks about the amazing things God has put in him.
  Perhaps if he had perfect knowledge the discussion would be unnecessary because He would simply impart whatever wisdom was necessary to make all parties understand.
  Of course, perhaps he would have a bigger plan that involved many more people, most of whom weren't born yet, and would need to devise a way to reveal himself to them and hope to make them willing participants in His plan...perhaps.

3)
  "Knowledge from afar" ~ this is akin to [1 John 2:27]() which echoes the sentiment that God does, indeed, teach us directly.
  "ascribe righteousness" ~ it is good to understand that God is the source of righteousnes...
  ...however, the subsequent verse seems to unravel any potential humility from humanness.

5) despise ~ to look down on with disrespect;
  God does not hate _people_; He loves His creation.
  However, by His very nature He "looks down" when he looks at anything.
  He _condescends_ in anything He does because His natural place is above everything else.
  He does, in fact, respect all creatures because He freely made them and endowed them with amazing attributes.

6) <sigh> I don't know how we are several hours/days into the conversation and still not seeing through this point.
  Wicked people live, breathe and work right now.
  There are wicked people in positions of power and great wealth right now.
  Whether they continue breathing and working is entirely God's perogative.
  Just so, there are righteous people suffering in sickness, imprisonment, poverty and oppression.
  Whether that continues is also entirely God's perogative.
  When a fundamental point of our belief is obviously contradicted by multiple lines of evidence it is folly to hold onto it.

7) This is plain truth.
  The destiny of the righteous is togetherness with God.
  Righteousness is given by God.
  [Rev 2-3]() has numerous enthronement texts referring to the believer(s).

8-12) vv.8-10 are essentially gospel truth...undone by vv.11-12.
  God tries valiantly to "open their ears" but is not always successful.
  Encountering God **hardens our hearts**- this is not an antiquated way to say that he makes us rebellious but, rather, He emboldens us to be more of what we are.
  In some that hardening becomes self-deprecation that leads to humility and repentance.
  In others it becomes self-aggrandizement that leads to pride and rebellion.

11) **FALSE** - there is no Biblical guarantee of prosperity for the believer...ever.
  There is more warning of slips, trips, and falls than any of that.
  [Is 43](), [Deut 32]()

12) I think this is misguidance- there are cases of knowleadgeable, will ful rebellion against God.
  Further, there is no promise of immediate retribution for wrongdoing.
  If it were so, none of us would stand a chance.
  God is patient beyond words- no desiring any to be separated from Him.
  [Rom 2:4](), [Rom 3:23](), [Rom 6:23]()

13) This is an apt description of rebels...which fits us all.

14) Again, this is refuted by life experience- the godless do not always suffer not literally "die in their youth".
  However, it is the circumstances of youth that shape us into the people we ultimately become.
  _QDS_ ~ qadesh; is a sanctuary or temple-prostitute (male in this case).
  These two meanings of the word may seem quite disparate.
  However, for the worshipper of false gods it is not that long a road to conflate sex magic with worship [of false gods].
  The notion that the wicked person _ends their life_ worshipping false gods in self-destructive and calling them "sacred" is quite real.
  People identify things they consider to _sacred_ based on their experiences and beliefs.
  We ought to be interested in what God considers sacred.

15) A seemingly rare nugget of pure truth from one of Job's friends.
  It is, indeed, trials that shape and instruct us.
  Re: C.S. Lewis- 
    God intially comes in and fixes and cleans the _cottage_ that is our life.
    Then, we undergo the chaos of remodeling and rebuilding.
    This we often mistake for God's abandonment or aloofness.
    But it is not, it is because a King does not live in a cottage- a King lives in a palace.
