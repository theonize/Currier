# Job 12


Job replying to Zophar


2) Job mocks them- but its well deserved.

3) Job reminds them, or perhaps informs them, of their equality.
   In fact, the greatest human genius is closer to the idiot than he is to God.
   He recognizes that most people share the delusion and hallucination of the three friends- it is ubiquitous through time.

4) Interestingly, Job points out: if God only blessed in response to our piety then the sinner would have no recourse.
   ...since we are all sinners that would be a precarious position for people.

5) The proud and arrogant do tend to assume their position to be of their own making.
   And vice versa.

6) Curious imagery here: that God fills His hand and offers it to us- we take from it as we will/can.
   God is providing His hands full of stuff to both the wicked and faithful.


7-12) An appeal to general revelation- the instruction of nature.

9) Natural, lower life-forms understand a creator.
   Humans ought too but we rail against it- even those of us who purport to believe only believe in God __as we know Him__.

11) Every breath a gift from the LORD.

12) Interesting metaphor of the flavor of words.
    Sometimes we swallow food without tasting, hastily imbibing just because;
    In fact, in modern first-world climes there are many who have never missed a meal and food is ubiquitous and boring.

    Some of us have a religious affection for food- presentation and flavorings and concoctions and combinations.
    There is an a relish of every sensual aspect of eating.

    Some of us know what to eat when to alleviate our brain and mind of dwelling on hardships-
    Emotional eaters are addicting to the massive redirection of blood to the gut and endorphins to the brain from massive amount of calories down our gullet.

    So, I suppose it is as such with words- sometimes we read because we must, sometimes because we want to, and sometimes because we can.
    None of this is to be disparged though, as C.S. Lewis quipped, "only jailors oppose escapism."
