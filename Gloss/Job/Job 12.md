# Job 12


2) Job mocks them- but its well deserved.

3) Job reminds them, or perhaps informs them, of their equality.
   In fact, the greatest human genius is closer to the idiot than he is to God.
   He recognizes that most people share the delusion and hallucination of the three friends- it is ubiquitous through time.

4) Interestingly, Job points out: if God only blessed in response to our piety then the sinner would have no recourse.
   ...since we are all sinners that would be a precarious position for people.

5) The proud and arrogant do tend to assume their position to be of their own making.
   And vice versa.

6) Curious imagery here: that God fills His hand and offers it to us- we take from it as we will/can.
   God is providing His hands full of stuff to both the wicked and faithful.
