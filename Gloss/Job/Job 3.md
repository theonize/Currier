# Job 3


3-10) The sorrow of Job is so great not only despises his own birth but his conception.
  In the midst of his sorrow he regrets the entirety of his life- he has desire to continue.

8) Leviathan...the great chaos beast of the seas


16-19) Interesting the he describes the abode of the decseased infant as a place of peace.
  This seems to bolster the idea that infants are innocent and pure- they are worthy to be in the presence of God.
  Though this passage does not explicitly designate this place as being in the presence of God, we might assume so since we are only given two options Biblically: weeping and gnashing of teeth or peace and security.


20-26) Why, indeed, is suffering allowed to persist?
  Further, why are the enlightened, the "saved" made to continue here?
  The trite answer is that God says so it is.
  v.23 establishes this in that God "hedges in" a man.
  Our most profound struggle is seeking to understand _why_ God does such things- and knowing He may never say.

  It is 4000 years [at least] since these events and, in the meantime, transmission of them through languages, politics, and cultures to me.
  That is a long plan of which Job could have no grasp.

25) It seems to be the common experience that what we dread the most eventually comes to bear on us.
  As human's we do possess the gift of the self-fulfilling prophecy.
  We also have a tendency to see demons in every shadow...and when we tire our sight and minds weaken to make the shadows and their contents bolder.
