# Job 28


1-11) He expounds on mining-tunneling as the purview of man to draw the distinction that wisdom is even harder to get.
      There is also something to be said for the diligent spelunker who braves the gloom to find treasures-
      in a sense we are that treasure, and God is the miner.


5) Fasinating that they knew the earth was full of fire-
   this is one of many examples in Job where the words reflect the ancient understanding but technically contradict scientific understanding (of course, our understanding is not complete either.)
   Fire is necessary for transformation of dead things to base materials, and base materials back to soil, and soil to life.

6) The brilliant blue and gold of lapus lazuli is indicative


12,20) Reiterating to make parallel points: wisdom is priceless and untraceable.


12-19) Wisdom is available to us but we don't know its source.
       This illuminates a fundamental error in most educational systems: imparting knowledge and rhetoric does not impart wisdom.
       These things may enable or allow us to gain wisdom but they do not grant it.

14) "Sea" is often an idiom for the masses, the throng of humanity.
    As plumb the depths of particles, or look out to the stars, we find knowledge but not wisdom.

15-16) Wisdom cannot be purchased, otherwise said: we can open ourselves to it and have it granted to us.

17-19) These are things highly prized in Job's economy.
       This helps date the book because things which are hard to produce have higher value.
       e.g. the raw materials for glass are widely available but the furnace and tools required are relatively advanced so glass was a luxury item until that ancillary technology become more common and the Romans began mass-producing it.
       e.g. coral and quartz are also common but hard to farm- so, their gathering requires more advanced technology.  Naval and diving equipment for coral, and mining equipment and techniques for quartz.
       i.e because gold & gemstones are just plain scarce, their value is fairly [relatively] consistent.


20-21) Saying that no one knows where wisdom comes from implies that there is a mystical quality to the imputation of wisdom [and knowledge].
       We create circumstances where knowledge and wisdom may spring up but the "that's funny" moment is divine perspiration and inspiration.

21) Saying that the birds cannot see the origin of wisdom is a nod to their cosmology because the birds, if anyone, would be "up there" where the gods are.
    If anyone could see it, they could.
    But neither is it down here, where eagles' eyes could pick it out.

22) Interesting that ruin and destruction are personified and that they are equally stumped as to the origin of wisdom.
    They have merely heard "news of it"- which is more than the living can say- but it may indicate that our mortality drives us along the path to wisdom.

23-24) God, obviously, knows where wisdom "is" and, because He knows all things He knows the best path for us to it.
       Additionally, this path is not necessarily the same for all.

25) The idea that the wind has "weight" it is a formidable concept for an ancient, and only nearly tractable for us- it is a powerful aero-fluid.
    Further, He not onlys limits the properties of air, i.e. gas molecular structures and there longevity, but there is limited quantity of air and water.
    ...and that quantity is precisely enough to balance our biome.

26) Recall that the ending of each rainstorm is enacted by the rainbow treaty.
    It may be that the water cycle we enjoy was quite different in ante-diluvian times.
    The paths of the lightning are equally limited- because the conditions for lightning are storminess (which is innately limited as with the above.)
    Further, lightning does not randomly spring up but is preceeded by certain conditions.
    ...which is interesting because, if we believe lightning to be a divine strike, it must necessarily be foreshadowed by storm.
    ...which is exactly our experience: especially in hindsight, we can see the events the loaded up prior to a devastation.

27) The thing, wisdom, that we yearn for it not even as high as God: God mulled it over and fashioned it as a part of the psychic universe with the path to it involving physical action.
    We do things and think about things and receive inspiration as is the "path" to wisdom.

28) The heart of wisdom- the fear of the LORD- is obviously a concept that pre-dates written scriptture.
    As with many of the lyrical lines from Job that end up in Psalms this wisdom concept [and others] find their way in Proverbs.
    This evolution of theology is organic, natural, and fully inspired.
    This is one of the finest examples of plenary inspiration, showcasing divine influence culminating in spoken, then written, word.
