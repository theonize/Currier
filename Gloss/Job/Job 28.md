# Job 28


1-11) He expounds on mining-tunneling as the purview of man to draw the distinction that wisdom is even harder to get.
      There is also something to be said for the diligent spelunker who braves the gloom to find treasures-
      in a sense we are that treasure, and God is the miner.


5) Fasinating that they knew the earth was full of fire-
   this is one of many examples in Job where the words reflect the ancient understanding but technically contradict scientific understanding (of course, our understanding is not complete either.)
   Fire is necessary for transformation of dead things to base materials, and base materials back to soil, and soil to life.

6) The brilliant blue and gold of lapus lazuli is indicative


12,20) Reiterating to make parallel points: wisdom is priceless and untraceable.


12-19) Wisdom is available to us but we don't know its source.
       This illuminates a fundamental error in most educational systems: imparting knowledge and rhetoric does not impart wisdom.
       These things may enable or allow us to gain wisdom but they do not grant it.

14) "Sea" is often an idiom for the masses, the throng of humanity.
    As plumb the depths of particles, or look out to the stars, we find knowledge but not wisdom.

15-16) Wisdom cannot be purchased, otherwise said: we can open ourselves to it and have it granted to us.

17-19) These are things highly prized in Job's economy.
       This helps date the book because things which are hard to produce have higher value.
       e.g. the raw materials for glass are widely available but the furnace and tools required are relatively advanced so glass was a luxury item until that ancillary technology become more common and the Romans began mass-producing it.
       e.g. coral and quartz are also common but hard to farm- so, their gathering requires more advanced technology.  Naval and diving equipment for coral, and mining equipment and techniques for quartz.
       i.e because gold & gemstones are just plain scarce, their value is fairly [relatively] consistent.
