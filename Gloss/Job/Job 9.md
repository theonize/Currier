# Job 9

Job's response to Bildad.

2) Job gives us another angle: that God truly only blesses the righteous but that God gives righteous.


9) Interesting that Job was aware of the southern hemisphere constellations.


11) True that we don't know God's face: we only know Him by His capability.


13) Rahab means pride and is likely a reference to a sea monster: a symbol of chaos.
