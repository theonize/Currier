# Job 9

Job's response to Bildad.

2) Job gives us another angle: that God truly only blesses the righteous but that God gives righteous.


9) Interesting that Job was aware of the southern hemisphere constellations.


11) True that we don't know God's face: we only know Him by His capability.


13) "Rahab" means pride and is likely a reference to a sea monster: a symbol of chaos.


14-20) "I can only beg my Judge for mercy."
       This epitomizes many people's view of God- it allows them to codify and understand justice, and deny part [or all] of God that doesn't meet their expectations.

17) Job's suffering is not without cause, its results are to be seen in his life and time immemorial.
    But he does not see it at this time and that is the lesson God has for him.

19-20) This is the really scary part of God, even if we could understand all the laws of nature and why God does what He does...He could change it in a blink without reason.
       However, He graciously gives us a universe of immutable order and reason so that we can know and experience Him.

21-24) Job's perceives that God doesn't care and, thus, becomes similarly uncaring, "if God doesn't care about my life, why should I?"
       This paradigm, that God is aloof and therefore doesn't matter, is not just common but a driving force in the world.
       It is excerbated by the fact that, even though God pursues us He will leave us be if we really want Him to (that is, in fact, what hell is all about.)

25-29) Job's is feeling a crushing pressure to submit.

26) "boats made of papyrus" is a reference to some swift naval vessel- this is amidst phrases about a fast runner and a fast flier.
    This eschews notions of ancient man's idiocy- they understood things like buoyancy and hydrodynamics- they just didn't have the advaned language of maths to describe it fully.

27-28) There is something to be said for __washing up__ to help overcome grief and trial; Jesus encouraged us [Matt 6] to wash ourselves and put on lotion while fasting so as not to appear sickly.
       However, fixing the facade does not fix the matter- though it can help facilitate the healing process.
       Deeper still, Job understands that unless God intervenes his heart will not be healed.

29-31) This is Job's despair in a nutshell: that even if he could pull hisself from the pit there is nothing for it.

31) "Even my clothes despise me!"  what an apt metaphor for hopelessness, it so shapes our psyche that those closest to us dont' want to be.

32-35) Job longs for reconciliation with God.
       He seems to have an instinctive understanding that God is the only one who can help him.
       However, he incorrectly surmises that there can be no mediator between him and God.
       Two human parties require a mediator because they are fallible, when one of the two is God, God can mediate.
       Point of fact, this is at the heart of the gospel: we require mediation [reconciliation] with God and that mediator must be divine but also human...

34) How often is fear of God the driver at the heart of the zealot?
    While many do not fear God, the zealot does.
    We fall into ruts of tradition and ceremony because we do not perceive God anymore but know that we need Him.
    We don't know what else to do.
  
35) This may be the most distressing part of suffering- the immense loneliness that comes from knowing God is there but not here.
    Coupled with the persistent admonishments of his wife & friends this is the very dark.
