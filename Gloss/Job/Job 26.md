# Job 26

Job responds to Bildad.
The intensity is growing.

2-4) Job is questioning the character of the speaker (for the first time.)
  We are admonished to do so with our teachers.
  As in 2nd Peter we are to be discerning of the lives of our teachers.
  One of the lessons of Job is that reasoned arguments are fruitless with someone who has low character because they will staunchly, subconsciously defend their position to prop up their lifestyle.

5-14) Job's discourse on the awesomeness of God.
      He looks to cosmology to expound on the greatness of God.
      Albeit, their cosmology was quite different than ours.

5) The trembling of the spirits may have multiple meanings:
   All of them cringe, in a way, at their predicament;
   All of them yearn for resurrection;
   And all of them are in awe of God.

6) God sees all things- even those separated from Him.
   Abaddon, the eternal abode of the worst of us, is in full view of God.

7) This is a fascinating foreshadowing of space, especially considering the beliefs of the day-
   They didn't know about the spherical earth let alone the curvature of space and the orbits of the planets...yet, in his simplicity, Job grasps the fundaments.

9) Makes you wonder where that cloud is...maybe the Big Arc...

10) Even with an ancient's view this does contradict modern science:
    The horizon was "created" resultant to the laws of nature and the shape of the Earth.
    The boundary between night and day is a result of the Earth's shpae and relative position of the sun.

11) This line is a little more archaic: the pillars of the sky represent whatever structure keeps heaven from crashing down the earth.
    This is quite real but not a glass dome as in the ancients' thinking.

12) The great sea monster, and her destruction, is a trope about God's power over chaos.
    The sea sometimes represents humanity- the serpent dwells in the sea- and God stirs up the sea to arouse the serpent(s).
    Note that God defeats the chaos monster in the sea "by His understanding"...not by direct power.

13) Is there a mazzaroth connection in the hand-piercing-serpent?

14) Fringes have a couple meanings here:
    First, they are just the outer edge of the main garments, just the bits at the tip.
    Second, the fringe of an ancient's robe was hemmed in such a way to denote their rank or status.
    We see just the barest glimpse of what God truly is, but what we see is enough to ascribe Him kingship.
