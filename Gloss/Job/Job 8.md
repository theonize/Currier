# Job 8

Bildad joins the conversation.


3) Does God...?  The simple answer to Bildad's question is **no**.
   However, is it a fallacy for us to presume to know what is __just__ and __right__.
   God thinks about acts at a much higher level than we.

4) Bildad may be acknowledging some truth of Job's children's sin, but equating that to their death is not only insensitive but incorrect in the light of experience and his lack of "big picture" understanding.

5-6) This is technically, Biblically true.
     However, our righteousness is not something that can be attained- it must be given by God.

7) This is not universally true: it seems to be generally true that goodness yields prosperity but experience shows that this is not always the case.

8-12) Here he admonishes Job to appeal to tradition.
      This is, indeed, a level better than appealing to just our own experience but not even all of human experience is sufficient to understand everything.

13-18) Again, it is technically true that the destiny of the godless is destruction- vivisection from God.
       However, there are many examples of the godless prospering and the godly suffering- it behooves us to begin reconciling this.

17-18) Bildad begins to acknowledge that the godless person has shaky foundations yet "spreads" quickly.
       However, he abandons this point with the assumption of their earthly decline.

19) This is a universal truth: for the godless this life is the best they will ever have; for the godly, this life is the worst they will ever have.

20-21) Ad naseum: more general truth that applies in finality, but not in the current circumstance.
