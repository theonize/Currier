# Zophar
...the zealous


Zophar is all about piety and finding God in cultic action.
A cult, in the technical sense, is simply a system of religious action.
He repeatedly injects the ideal that __doing__ is the way to get a good response from God.
This is, of course, nonsense considering that God will do what God will do regardless.
