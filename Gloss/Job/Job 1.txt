Job 1


The Satan is not necessarily a devil and refers to a role rather than an individual.
It means "adversary" as in, accuser... think: opposing counsel.
The Satan is a member of the divine council and is not necessarily evil.
We tend to repulse the idea of a good-guy being The Satan because he causes so much suffering but here are some things to consider when evaluating this idea:
- Can evil beings come into God's court?
- There are other cases where good-guys dole out harm
  - The angel of death in Exodus
  - The angel that kills 185,000 Assyrians in 2 Kings
- God is sovreign over all events that cause suffering and he does not yield authority;  we eschu the idea of God causing suffering because we believe in His goodness but, perhaps, we simply don't understand the bigger picture.
The Satan is not necessarily a devil and refers to a role rather than an individual.  It means "adversary" as in, accuser... think: opposing counsel.


8) It is God who introduced Job into the mix.
We should take this to heart: God will try His most loyal followers as testimonies.


10) What is this hedge?  Perhaps communion with Yahweh that naturally repels sin/evil?
I think so and I think the blessing is a different incarnation of the same thing.
