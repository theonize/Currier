Job 1


The Satan is not necessarily a devil, basing solely on this text.
"The Satan" is a role, a job title, rather than an individual.
It means "adversary" as in, accuser... think, opposing counsel or prosecutor.
The Satan is a member of the divine council and is not necessarily evil (again, based solely on this text.)
We tend to repulse the idea of a good-guy being The Satan because he causes so much suffering but here are some things to consider when evaluating this idea:
- Can evil beings come into God's court?
- There are other cases where good-guys dole out harm
  - The angel of death in Exodus
  - The angel that kills 185,000 Assyrians in 2 Kings
- God is sovreign over all events that cause suffering and He does not yield authority;  we eschu the idea of God causing suffering because we believe in His goodness but, perhaps, we simply don't understand the bigger picture.

Now, based on subsequent events where The Satan seems to act in opposition to Yahweh and theological development in years hence we come to a much cleaner realization of The Satan as an evil being.
As these events [ostensibly] take place in the patriarchal times there is much pragma to be had in the events of the Exodus and the state of Israel.
While we can confidently make a case for The Satan being Lucifer and the antagonist of John's apocalypse, we must remember not to simply import and apply them carelessly here.

For instance: it is God who offers up Job, is it God who is sovreignly responsible for Job's suffering, it is God who alone who can answer the question as to why these things happen.  The point of the book is that God does not have to.


8) It is God who introduced Job into the mix.
We should take this to heart: God will try His most loyal followers as testimonies.


10) What is this hedge?  Perhaps communion with Yahweh that naturally repels sin/evil?
More modern theology might suggest the Holy Spirit or a band of angels.
I think so and I think the blessing is a different incarnation of the same thing.


13-18) The news of Job's destruction arrives all at once.
       However, we should note that there are many precursor events that must have happened leading up to the disasters:
       * The Sabeans planned a plunder and prepared for it
       * The "fire from heaven", be it a meteor or lightning, was put into place by natural forces
       * The Chaldeans also planned and prepared a raid
       * The windstorm [that killed his children] was part of a weather system
       God is sovreign over (in control of) all these events and what led up to them.
       The entirety of parallel sequences of events was orchestrated to land at once.
