Job 1


The Satan is not necessarily a devil and refers to a role rather than an individual.  It means "adversary" as in, accuser... think: opposing counsel.


8) It is God who introduced John into the mix.
We should take this to heart: God will try His most loyal followers as testimonies.


10) What is this hedge?  Perhaps communion with Yahweh that naturally repels sin/evil?
I think so and I think the blessing is a different incarnation of the same thing.
