# Job 18

Bildad reiterates his position that the wicked are **always** judged on Earth.
Forgetting the fact that the wicked had to go up in order to come down (succeed in order to lose __everything__), Bildad is set in his stance.
Further, if this stance was true then none of us would ever attain anything because we are fundamentally wicked- goodness is gotten from God.

2) A common refrain from those whose arguments are failing.
   People who cannot come to a discernable, valid point often continue ad naseum as if to wear down their opponent.

3) This is a truism- that when people are presented with their error they feel stupid.
   I don't think that was Job's intent, nor was it his intent to win an argument.
   But Job's exploration of the issues and staunch belief have ruptured the "friends" world-view.

4) The friends understand that, if Job is right, the paradigm of their lives is spent.

5-21) It is simply not true that all wicked people suffer in this life.
      Evil is not necessarily self-destructive.
      Often it is quite the opposite.
      There are many examples of wicked men who have committed atrocities and die, in power, at a ripe old age.
