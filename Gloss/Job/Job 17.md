# Job 17

1-2) Not only is Job headed for death but is being bludgeoned along the way.

2) He calls out the "mockers" as being in rebellion against God- because they speak truisms which are not applicable to Job and even extrapolate from those to denegrate he and his children.

3) Job is desperate for an advocate.

4-5) He is beginning to see the end of his friends as well.
     They are denouncing him to prop up their own righteousness- which never ends well.
