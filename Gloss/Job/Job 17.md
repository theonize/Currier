# Job 17

1-2) Not only is Job headed for death but is being bludgeoned along the way.

2) He calls out the "mockers" as being in rebellion against God- because they speak truisms which are not applicable to Job and even extrapolate from those to denegrate he and his children.

3) Job is desperate for an advocate.

4-5) He is beginning to see the end of his friends as well.
     They are denouncing him to prop up their own righteousness- which never ends well.

6-10) We see here an understanding of two things: God has done this thing to Job, and [in God's economy] there is a propensity for the righteous to prosper.
      In fact, the propsering of the righteous and dismay of the wicked is a common theme in the Bible- especially in Proverbs and other wisdom passages.
      However, though we [rightly] perceive this as the natural order it is still at the discretion of God.
      And God has done this thing to Job to make him a testimony for the ages.
      
11-16) There are some interesting image parallels with [Jonah 2]() here:
       but Job did not have the benefit of Jonah's hindsight;
       he did not have centuries of theological development and experience to establish God's character toward salvation and redemption.
       ...it is being established in his story.
