1-6) Eliphaz rightly sizes up the situation

7-9) v7 is technically correct, however he conflates this idea with judgment which is not Yahwism.
     In the sight of Yahweh there are none innocent, and those who are blameless are so because of propitiation and adoption.


12-21) Here Eliphaz recounts and experience of his that spoke a "word of truth" but there is no guarantee that this divine encounter was Yahweh.
       There are other "divine" beings in the world.
       Further, even if Eliphaz had experienced Yahweh directly there is not consensus that that knowledge and experience extrapolates to all human experience: a sample size of one is not a population.
