# Job 15

Eliphaz's reply

2-6) Eliphaz likens Job's accounting of his own circumstances to bluster.
     In light of Eliphaz's world-view he cannot bear any notion of God causing suffering in a righteous person.
     Further, the very expression of despair is anathema to Eliphaz.

7-13) Now we begin to see a little deeper into the friends' issues with Job:
      he is young and, throughout the conversation, has solidly opposed their world-view.
      However, this is an intellectually honest treatise- who are mere humans to yield the truths of God?
      The answer is in the testimony.

14) The answer is: whatever God deigns.

15-16) This is, of course, rhetorical; but, it is short-sighted to think that God would not [or could not] utilize creatures at every strata.

16) I think this is an unwarranted insult but there is also truth in it:
    we humans are revolting and corrupt, in need of a bath (Ezekiel 16:4-14).

17-19) Again, Eliphaz declares what __he__ has seen: as if his experience was indicative of all human experience.
       He further conflates this thing "I have seen" with some arcane knowledge of the original ancestors.

20-35) It is simply not true that the wicked suffer in this life- we have many examples to the contrary.
       He is also wrong in his incinuation that Job is wicked for "blaming" God.
       Perhaps "blame" is a bit too pedantic a term but God is sovereign and, as such, is responsible for all things.
       Neither is it wrong to confront God.
       Though this is not good as a matter of course it is sometimes necessary for edification and growth.

34) This is (?maybe?) the first specific accusation against Job: bribery.
    Eliphaz references the loos of children and destruction of property.

35) In fine fashion, Eliphaz concludes with a flourish of truth.
    It is true that people tend to progenerate their own kind.
