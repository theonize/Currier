# Job 19


Things are heating up between the friends.

3-6) Job makes an excellent point- they are digging for some sin he's committed because it is not obvious.
     In fact, it is non-existent (God said so in the prologue)...not that Job was sinless but he was blameless and, by all accounts, a decent fellow.

5-6) The 3 are certainly trying to attain superiority;
     probably not to lord over him, after all he has nothing, but to prop up their ideals and paradigms- without which they would be shattered.

7-12) Job is in a pitious state.
      ...but the new man inside me is so grateful that he was and endured because:
      * we now have his testimony
      * we have this progression and enhancement of our understanding of God's grace and mercy

     None of these statements about the God's wrath are untrue, it is the design of the plan.
     However, even the cumulative effects against Job are an infinitesimal fraction of what God could deliver if He wanted.
     And, God's __want__ is what is at the forefront in this story:
     if He wanted to destroy us, He would have;
     if He wanted to redeem us, He would establish a lineage of stories and accompnaying text to reveal Hisself to us.


13) God has caused a separation between Job and his friends.

14) People do tend to put sufferers out-of-mind

15) Job's state, physical, mental, and spiritual, has made him unrecognizable to those closest to him.
    The word AMH is a concubine- someone who was certainly close to Job; even they don't recognize him.

16) Job's servants don't respond to his requests anymore

17-20) Job's wife, family, and friends are disgusted by him.
       ...the description of his physical state, coupled with his mental anguish, makes it unsurprising that they abandoned him.

21-22) Interesting that Job collates the persecution of people with God's persecution.
       It seems that persecuting Job has become a new hobby of many.

23-24) They are!
       He was so close to seeing it here- maybe it clicked later in life.
       ...his story is for us, and those before us, and those yet to come.
       We are Bildad, Zophar, and Eliphaz.
       We say we want to be righteous but (I suspect) would not accept the trials that Job endured.

25) This verse gives an indication of the period in which it took place-
    "leaded tablets" were a means of filling the inscription on a clay tablet with metal to give it some kind of permanence.
    The iron stylus was a tool that needed, oddly enough, iron-age technology to forge.
    In light of this Job did not pre-date Abraham and did not post-date the judgees-period.

25-27) Job believes in a resurrection- before the Bible, before Christianity, before Judaism.
       God will "stand on the dust"; BDB likens this the storm of dust after a seige.  It is representative of the filth of malice and destruction.
       ...**after** my skin has been destroyed, I will see God **in the flesh**.
       "I" will see Him...
       "My eyes" will look...

28-29) This is the clarion call of the neo-atheist-materialist:
       God does despicable things, so He is no good- why follow Him?

29) God's wrath does come to Earth from time to time.
    We perceive some of it, just often enough, to bear the reminder of greater things than us.
