# Job 6

Job's answer to Eliphaz


1-4) Job is counting the weight of all his calamities as proof that his level of complaint is valid.
     He is also noting that it is God who is responsible for it.


5) A creature does not complain when it is cared for.

6-7) Life without any good is horrid- it is undesirable to continue in.

8-9) An honest cry from despair: the sufferer would rather die than continue suffering.
     Yet, Job does not suicide- he sees that as the perogative of God.

10) "the words of the Holy One"- Job understands that God is still there in the midst of suffering

11-13) Job unknowingly answers his own overriding question: he is still suffering because that is God's plan (part of which includes us reading this story.)
       He is continuing on because God gives him the strength to do so.

13) Job's feeling of hopelessness is valid, but the sentiment is not- there is always hope.
    God can destroy or deliver in an instant if he so chooses.

14-20) Job admonishes his compatriots for their unfriendliness- something which they do not heed.
       He points out their unreliability and links it to their lack of fear of God; their fear is of their own beliefs being undermined.

21-23) Job did not ask for help and the "friends" did not offer it.
       Job links their lack of charity to a fear of fear- they do not want to confront their own perceptions because they might, possibly, be dismantled.

24-30) Job is open to correction but, as he points out, the "friends" are not able to correct him.
       They are ultimately unable to link Job's suffering to any sin.
