# Job 23

Job responding to Eliphaz


2-9) The futile search for God is not because we look in the wrong place, but in the wrong manner.
     God is omnipresent, we don't have to __go__ anywhere to find Him, we must become able.
     That ability comes from Him- this dichotomy is central to Christian mysticism.
     The notion is that we must act in God's power in order to be with Him but He must empower us to do so.

10) This is a Godly hope: that testing will indeed bear fruit on Earth.
    Its noble, and even tractable (for some), to know they are part of a greater plan for good and sacrifice themselves for it.
    But, as God's testimonies on Earth, it does not behoove Him to always allow His children to be destroyed-
    a) Our suffering grieves Him
    b) There is always on occassion for God to be glorified through our circumstances- the more vital the event, the more glory.

11) The imagery here is fantastic-
    There are many who walk the path and sometimes step off to frollick in the weeds or they pause to gaze into the distance to one side or another.
    But that is a far cry from those who set the jaw and set off in a trek perpendicular to the way of the Spirit.

12) The fact that Job holds to his innocence is a sticking point for the friends-
    surely anyone so totured would give in unless they were propped up by the Spirit.

    The notion of the Word as food evolved from this point to the instantiation of actual manna to the psalms of sustenance found in God.
    Not only is it important in it's culmination in Jesus Christ but also in the understanding that without an underlying __logos__ beyond __gnosis__ we are lost- mere tumbleweeds.

13-17) This is such a fascinating proof from God's immutability to providence:
       Because God is unchanging, His plans are fixed as well.
       Therefore they must have been perfectly set in the beginning.
       Yet, we perceive a roiling chaos of the flow of life.
       The fact that His plans allow for our freedom and yet were predestined is a frightening paradox.
       God is beyond the mechanisms and philological underpinnings of history and future.

17) This is the flip-side of the hope of v.12;  we are hemmed in but not undone.
