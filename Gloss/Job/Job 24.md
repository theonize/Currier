# Job 24


Job is describing wickedness and its ramifications for those who surround them.
The ending "prove me a liar" tells us he is drawing a distinction between himself and the truly wicked-
Job's servants fared well and he did not do evil against them.
The friends attempts to eak out some modicum of wickedness in Job to prove their point is insulting and detrimental to a man who has tried to be good.


1) "his days" refers to the final judgment.
   What later would become, cololquially, the "day of the Lord."
   In this "pre-scripture" time, there was an understanding that this judgment of God was good for the faithful and not good for the wicked.


2-12) This is a treatise on the wicked and their effects on society.

12) Does God really ignore suffering?  Or can we come to terms with it being part of a bigger plan?
    It is difficult to stomach that idea that God allows evil to happen.
    But the alternative is to declare that pompous, powerful, pedophile politician is somehow morally superior to the man under the bridge dying of exposure.
    We cannot judge our righteousness based on our circumstances.
    In general it is true that righteousness tends toward prosperity and wickedness tends toward poverty.
    However, there is nuance such as that people vacillate between good & bad behavior- they also change course in their lives at times.

13-17) Darkness is the abode of the wicked.
   Darkness is the absence of light, since we mainly perceive reality through our light receptacles we assume that we our hidden when we cannot see.
   But God sees more- just as their is radiation outside the visible spectrum there are powers outside the natural that sway this one.
   God dwells there, as well as here, and sees what we cannot.
   I know there is spiritual darkness that clouds our consciousness-
   we assume that because we cannot perceive that we are hidden, but God sees.
