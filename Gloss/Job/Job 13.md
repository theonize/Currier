# Job 13

Job continues replying to Zophar

1-5) Job retorts that, obviously, he has the same level of experience as all of these detractors.
     In fact, he is the only one of the four who can speak from a place of truth: he knows he is innocent.
     Again, this innocence is not absolute but legal- he is not sinless but his guilt has been extinguished.

6-12) This is one of best logical progressions toward the true nature of God and His character.
      It begins with a defense of "my" belief in God.

7. God does not need our defense
8. He does not need us to, nor can we, twist things in His favor
9. He sees right through our shields
10. He would not even accept our devious help if we could offer it
11. We are smitten at the very sight of His true power
12. Human geniuses are idiots before Him


13-19) Job is willing to risk damnation, from being wrong, because he feels that he knows God's character.

15) This is the crux of Job's entire case: God is still God no matter what happens to Job...the Savior.

16) An interesting consideration:
    - no godless person would bother to goto God in this life.
    - in the next life the godless will be separated from Him.

20-28) This is Job's honest assessment of his predicament(s)- that God has done it.

21) It's the same hand of judgment that also protects.
    If we lost our fear of God, we would fall out of His grace.

22) This is a turning point where Job appeals for God's response rather than talking __about__ God.

23) Legally, Job's record is clean because God declared it so (ch 1-2).
    Note the distinction of sin vs transgression: some things are done impromptu, willful sin is another matter.

24-25) Job understands that God values humanity more than the rest of creation.
       To God, we are not leaves blowing in the wind.

26) Curious if this reference to "iniquities of my youth" relates to his disease- perhaps something resulting from an indiscretion that had previously healed.
    More obviously: we all have a littany of stupid, youthful mistakes that can haunt us.

27) Re: [Psalm 139:5](), God puts limits on us.
    "A line around the roots of my feet" ~ a wonderful analogy for providential effort: we place each step of our own free will but the possibilities are extremely limited.

28) The decline from aging and abuse is a profound flavoring in human life.
    This is why we are admonished to have elders (as in, the elderly) in leadership: because they have the experience.
