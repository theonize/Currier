# Job 39

1-4) Obviously the presence of such creatures means they reproduce.
  These are skittish and their gestational cycles vary based on the environmental factors.

In part, this treatise serves as an educational, rhetorical lecture to prompt the human to understanding.
  God is outlining things that He knows in question format so that He will appear wise _and_ believers will be encouraged toward discovery.
  This is far beyond the fickleness of false gods and the erudite naivete of man-made gods.


5-8) We tend to disregard that which is beyond our purview.
  "The wild" is a place where stuff happens that we don't perceive and we doubt it's relevance and God's stewardship of it.

9-12) The ox is/was an integral part of agriculture.
  The truth is that an ox, if so inclined, could probably leave almost any pen on a whim- fences and panel-walls are merely suggestions to them.
  But they are innately subservient to humans despite never losing their "wildness'.


13-18) The ostrich stands as a symbol of narcissism- somehow it procreates though it has no instinct or desire for raising its young.

13) essentially the ostrich wings are useless for flight, what real use they serve is ?unknown?

19-25) The majesty of a horse in battle is divine.
  The horse is seemingly meant for combat even though its creative origin preceeded man's wars.
  Much like the dog the horse can attain an affinity for its handler- unlike the dog the horse has a shoulder for labor as well.

26-30) The true majesty of the eagle (and hawk)- in fact all beasts- is that they were designed by fiat.
  They were not individually crafted cell-by-cell but by a universe that was spun into motion from a word which imbued laws and means to create such things.

It is not by God's direct, daily command that these beings operate, either.
  Rather, it is by His original command that spun all things into being and created the laws by which we all operate.
  That original command was so powerful that it was seeded with every pressure necessary to exert His providential will at the right time.
