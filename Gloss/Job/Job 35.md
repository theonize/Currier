# Job 35

1) And Elihu continues...again...still...

2-3) Whether it is _just_ or not not- God declared Job righteous.
     The profit is the righteous one who can now be with God.
     It is not just a slave set free who now has the opportunity to walk alongside God.
     Moreso, it is the child grown into an autonomous adult who returns home because they want to.

4) Just because someone can give an answer doesn't mean its a good one.
   Less so if its a quick answer.
   Albeit, some people have already thought deeply about an issue so the answer is on the "tip of their tongue" but that usually distinct from the quick, general answer meant to evoke respect where none is due.

5-8) Now Elihu's trods into universalist territory:
     if we cannot affect God's state, and He is good, then won't He just save everyone.
     The Biblical response is that God **will not** be in the presence of sin [in heaven] adn **He wants us there**, so He made a way.
     That way involves making right was is wrong- not be excusing or painting over it but through thorough remodeling.

9) Indeed, we tend to go to God only when our strength fails.


10-11) 
  Elihu appears to stumble into a truth while trying to setup his point:
  We question God while, all the while, receiving the blessings of His creation.
  We receive comfort and insight _out of the blue_ and, in our pride, fail to attribute it to God.
  Often it comes through providence and, because we disregard that part of His nature, we assume it to be "natural"; i.e. of ourselves or another person.

12-14)
  God is not deaf when we complain, nor when we sorrow.
  Indeed, if God did not hear the cries of the proud then He would never had heard me!
  Though God does put the scoffer on the shelf, He never fails to take them down occassionally to show them mercy and grace enough to open their eyes...even if they refuse to see.
  Our case is before God and, unlike an earthly court, He has read it and will judge it when it time to do so **according to the bigger plan**.

15)
  It should go without saying that all people deserve death.
  But whose punishment and transgression is Elihu referring to here?
  He seems to run over Job but what about the 4 tribes that stole or decimated Job's possessions?
  Was their sin so much less than Job's that his wealth should be transferred to them?
  We see now that God was erecting a tale that would enlighten billions of people to the providential grace and mercy of His testimony _through_ humans.
  But what, also, of the weather that collapsed the building and killed Job's children?
  What sin was so great to merit that kind of retribution that we are **all** guilty of?  
  Thereby why do we not all suffer the same fate?

16)
  Job does, indeed, open his mouth a fair bit.
  And if assume that God gives knowledge and wisdom, and He gives them through life lessons, then Job should a fair bit accumulated.
  But Elihu describes these as "empty talk".
  Far be it from us to discount the life experience, and subsequent learnings, of another person.
  What a travesty that, instead of working together toward understanding, we should try to wrestle them into our paradigm.
