12+) It is important to distinguish the way God speaks and the way Elihu speaks.
  Elihu presumes to know the nature and functionality of the universe;
  he talkes about "the balancing of the clouds" or "the skies, hard as...cast metal".
  These are the prespective of an ancient cosmologist.

  God does not give deference to pride and sin but He does have a plan to bring them into submission.
  Thus, He continually monitors for signs of turning.
