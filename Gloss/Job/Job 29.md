# Job 29


2-6) Job is nostalgic for the amenities of being in God's care.
     My first inclination is to pfft at that.
     However, Job is lamenting his current state because he recognizes the profound pleasure of being in God's grace.

6) "the rock poured out oil"
   - wondering if there was some mysterious childhood event lingering in his mind
   - probably this is a an allegorization of his extreme abundance producing manifold milk and oil (herds and orchards)
   - of course, the oil represents annointing (the pleasure of God in man)- the rock being God's salvation.
   - there is also a throwback to wanderers coming to rest in the promised land- several times in the story a rock produced liquid; the land "flowed" with milk and honey.
