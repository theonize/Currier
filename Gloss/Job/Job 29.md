# Job 29


2-6) Job is nostalgic for the amenities of being in God's care.
     My first inclination is to pfft at that.
     However, Job is lamenting his current state because he recognizes the profound pleasure of being in God's grace.

6) "the rock poured out oil"
   - wondering if there was some mysterious childhood event lingering in his mind
   - probably this is a an allegorization of his extreme abundance producing manifold milk and oil (herds and orchards)
   - of course, the oil represents annointing (the pleasure of God in man)- the rock being God's salvation.
   - there is also a throwback to wanderers coming to rest in the promised land- several times in the story a rock produced liquid; the land "flowed" with milk and honey.


7-11) Job is reminiscing when he was foremost among the leaders of his region.
      The powerful and influential people around him listened to him and respected him.

12-17) Remember that God declared Job righteous: [Job 1:8]() and [Job 2:3]().
       However, here we see the shallowness of Job's righteousness.
       It was not uncouth or dissembling but it was effort apart from Providence.
       Job did these things through rote and religion- later we will see that he encounters God and moves to encapsulate the ideals of all 4 men at this table in true Godly righteousness:
       - Works
       - Zeal
       - Tradition
       - Experience
