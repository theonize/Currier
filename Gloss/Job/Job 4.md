1-6) Eliphaz rightly sizes up the situation
     Job is a man of wealth and influence, now despondent- if anyone should be listened to it is he.

4-5) Job will later recount this: "I have heard of You, but now I see You with my eyes." (Job 42:5)
     It is rare that we learn just by perceiving- we must go through it to learn.

6) Confidence, indeed, comes from fear of God;
     However, hope in our integrity is counter to this.
     Not because integrity is not a powerful ally, but because we don't create our integrity- it is created in us...so augment the Creator!
     Eliphaz is tongue-in-cheek, borderline insulting here with an undertone stating that Job isn't really as pious and righteous as he thinks he is.
     ...which is accurate but not precise: God has already declared Job righteous.

7-9) v7 is technically correct, however he conflates this idea with judgment which is not Yahwism.
     In the sight of Yahweh there are none innocent, and those who are blameless are so because of propitiation and adoption.


12-21) Here Eliphaz recounts an experience of his, a secret "word of truth" but there is no guarantee that this divine encounter was Yahweh.
       There are other "divine" beings in the world.
       Further, even if Eliphaz had experienced Yahweh directly there is no evidence that that knowledge and experience extrapolates to all human experience.
       A sample size of one is not a population.
     We note the "proof" of this divine encounter, proofs that echo through centuries in various experiential methods:
     * waking vision
     * night encounter
     * while others were resting/unknowing
     * trepidation
     * physical reaction
       * shaking
       * breeze
       * goose flesh
     * a premonition
     * a disembodied voice

17) Can a mortal be righteous?
     Yes, but not by their own power.
     The righteousness of a mortal is a gift from God, not a product of his own actions.
     This is the crux of the matter: Eliphaz is correct in his assessment of the situation, but he is incorrect in his application of that assessment to Job.
     Job is righteous, but not by his own power.
     Job is righteous because God has declared him so.
