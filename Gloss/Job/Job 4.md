1-6) Eliphaz rightly sizes up the situation
     Job is a man of wealth and influence, now despondent- if anyone should be listened to it is he.

4-5) Job will later recount this: "I have heard of You, but now I see You with my eyes." (Job 42:5)
     It is rarely enough that we perceive something to obtain the lesson in it- we must go through it to learn.

6) Confidence, indeed, comes from fear of God;
     However, hope in our integrity is counter to this.
     Not because integrity is not a powerful ally, but because we don't create our integrity- it is created in us...so augment the Creator!

7-9) v7 is technically correct, however he conflates this idea with judgment which is not Yahwism.
     In the sight of Yahweh there are none innocent, and those who are blameless are so because of propitiation and adoption.


12-21) Here Eliphaz recounts and experience of his that spoke a "word of truth" but there is no guarantee that this divine encounter was Yahweh.
       There are other "divine" beings in the world.
       Further, even if Eliphaz had experienced Yahweh directly there is not consensus that that knowledge and experience extrapolates to all human experience: a sample size of one is not a population.
