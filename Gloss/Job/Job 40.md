# Job 40


2) This is the crux of the matter _against_ Job.
  However, the Lord does not pursue charges or retribution against Job.
  In fact, God does not purse retribution against any of us- it is not necessary for HIm to do so.
  The notion of separation from God is a **human** idea.
  God created a place where beings could be separate from Him **at their behest**.
  So, it will be Job's response to this question that secures his fate.
  It is not because God requires an answer, Job does.
  It is not because God demands and accounting, Job does.

3-5) And what could he say?
  What can any of us say?
  When faced with unfathomable depths of the oceans of the sub-atomic and the beyondment of the clusters of galaxies...
  what could we possibly bring to the table.

6-9) God says get ready, but it is hopeless to oppose Him or compete with Him.


10-13) Isn't it interesting the point that God makes here- we judge the mightiness of a ruler by their abillity to put down enemies.
  God does not do such things- He redeems and restores His enemies.

10) "Adorn yourself" such a thing is not possible- only God can give these things.

13) "Hide their faces in the place of hiding" ~ we hide our face when we are embarassed; why hide another's face?
  In that culture a man may hide his wife's face, in a way to save it for himself only (only the intimate family sees the womens' faces);
  In a way to diminish her sexual influence over others.
  Hiding the face of an enemy is supression and ownership [of a sort].

14) Moreover, this paragraph constitues a delineation between the power of God and the power of man.
  The "overflowings of our anger" are not so great as they would be of God.
  We cannot usually abase a single proud man, let alone all of them, let alone binding them.


Behemoth
  Whether this describes an actual animal is a matter of debate- behemoth is certainly a moniker for the bearer of chaos.
  The physical description seems to fit a large dinosaur, but the paleontological data does not.
  Considering that these cultures' histories were driven by word of mouth it is surprising that we have carried an accurate description of a dinosaur for so long and that any human would have co-existed with one.
  Regardless, the point of the passage is to expound on majesty and glory of the beast to make the point that God is greater...far greater.
  
  Behemoth is a created being- this applies whether it is/was physical or divine.
  It eats grass- grass being symbolic of the fleeting nature of life; Mark points out the _green grass_ during one of Jesus' teachings as lift for the concept of the souls ripe for the gospel.
  It is not a predator and, yet, is indomitable.
  The strength of the loins may refer to its able to procreate, and certainly affect its locomotion.
  The power of the belly, the core of the beast, is its raw strength in maintaining its position.
  The stiff tail adds stability, perhaps even graceful movement, to the beast.
  The structural frame of the beast is indestructible.
  Bronze is symbolic of the power of judgment, iron of war.
  Not only are his "implements" strong but they are capable of meeting out judgment and war as required.

  Both the Behemoth (here) and Wisdom (Proverbs 8:22) are RAS't DRC' - the first of God's "ways" or "works";
  It could be that the two are synonymous, the powerful behemoth being the embodiment of wisdom able to act in judgment and ware, but also able to stroll in peace.
  Or, we could draw a distinction that Wisdom was the first work of 'HVH whereas Behemoth was the first of AL - Yahweh had wisdom whereas Behemoth was a creation of God (more generally.)
  Also, we notice the paleontogical discrepancy of Behemoth being present at the creation as the _first work_ of God.
  This is not physically possible, implying [at least] that the notion of Behemoth, or the divine Behemoth, is more than a physical creature.
  If such a creature existed and was seen by humans it was not the sole embodiment of _Behemoth_ but a shadow or physique of the original.

20) The mountains yielding food is two-fold here:
  To the ancient person the mountains were a dangerous place, even moderns require significant technology to traverse them.
  The mountains were also the abode of the gods- where the sky meets the earth.
  Behemoth's traversal of the mountains means that he could be near to the divine influence and also that he ate fruit which was inaccessible to other creatures.

21-22) Behemoth can lay out in the open without fear of being attacked.

23) A flooding or fast-flowing river is a dangerous thing for us- but not for the Behemoth.
  In that same way, we might be swept along by the streams of life but the chaos monster is not (and may barely notice the inundation.)
