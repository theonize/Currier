# Job 40


2) This is the crux of the matter _against_ Job.
  However, the Lord does not pursue charges or retribution against Job.
  In fact, God does not purse retribution against any of us- it is not necessary for HIm to do so.
  The notion of separation from God is a **human** idea.
  God created a place where beings could be separate from Him **at their behest**.
  So, it will be Job's response to this question that secures his fate.
  It is not because God requires an answer, Job does.
  It is not because God demands and accounting, Job does.

3-5) And what could he say?
  What can any of us say?
  When faced with unfathomable depths of the oceans of the sub-atomic and the beyondment of the clusters of galaxies...
  what could we possibly bring to the table.

6-9) God says get ready, but it is hopeless to oppose Him or compete with Him.

10) "Adorn yourself" such a thing is not possible- only God can give these things.
