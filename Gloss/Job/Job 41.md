# Job 41

Leviathan

As with Behemoth, Leviathan is a massive creature symbolizing divine chaos.
The most important thing is that God controls the sigils of chaos and their instantiation.
Being _of the sea_ it carries much more weight to say that a Leviathan may yet be in the depths even though no one has seen it.
However, whether there is enough food to support such a creature should be calculable.

Regardless, Leviathan is more than any man, of team of men, can handle.
It essentially does what it wants and answers only to God.
There is no harnessing or taming chaos.
We cannot even snatch and tame a pacifist like the blue whale, let alone one who fights back.


13) The outer garment is an interesting deux in that the garment represents the divine nature of the being.
  Just as Jesus shed His outer garment (went from God to man) so the Leviathan has a divine nature.
  This gives creedence to the duality of the Leviathan image: it has a divine nature that is implacable.
  It also has a physical nature.

14-32) Each of these descriptors is clearly physical.
  Though, as with many things, there is a dual nature and the physical is a reflection of the divine.
