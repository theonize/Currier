Mark 8


8) These "baskets" are wicker hampers...unlike the handbaskets of the earlier miracle.
	[Ex 16]


14-21) Not long after Jesus has fed 9000 people, using a dozen loaves of bread, the 12 disciples worry over 1 loaf of bread.

16) Perhaps they assumed Jesus was, like they would do, making a back-handed rebuke.


21) Jesus admonished them to understand these things: He was not rebuking them for not bringing bread.


23) Jesus took the man out of town because Bethsaida was previously cursed.

24) Interesting that the man knew was men and trees looked like: he was probably not blind from birth.
Also, interesting that he was seeing these _trees_ as men.
- Trees are idiomatic for divine council members
- [Ez 31]
- They were walking...where at? where to?

25) Jesus laid hands _again_ - this is where the man's sight was restored, previously it was not restoration but a vision.
