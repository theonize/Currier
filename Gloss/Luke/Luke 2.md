10) "Don't be afraid" is a platitude - it really can't be helped


14) peace among those with whom He is pleased
among ~ en = constructively "in" and "to"

49) Jesus first quote (chronologically)
Jesus only referred to Yahweh as Father - except at His separation on the cross

	[Rev 1:1] ~ the book is written **TO** Jesus

  ...from what to what?  growth implies seed -> plant -> fruit
  grow ~ `proekopten`, before trial;
