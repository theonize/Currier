# Luke 15

Of the 4 lost characters, 3 the which father goes to get, the prodigal was drawn back.

All three display God's joy over a sinner's repentance

Trinitarian allusion:
 shepherd ~ Son
 bride+light ~ Spirit
 father ~ Father

1-3) Directed at the religious elders because they don't see people the way God sees them.

4-7) 1%, very few sheep go astray and the shepherd goes to get them.

8-10) 10%, of the images are sought.
The woman is that one who goes to search.


12) The was no bank, the father would have had to liquidate one-third of his assets.
- one-third of the angels fell

18-19) The son was rehearsing a speech to manipulate the Father.
The Father circumvents the sons' plan, not by barring him, but by running to meet him.

20) The Father dies not even give the son the chance to approach and present his planned speech.
He runs, at the first sight of his lost son, and:
  1. Embraces him = acceptance as a son
  2. Kisses him = identifying in common nature


22) New garb:
  Robe ~ regnalty
  Ring ~ signet of the King's authority
  Sandals ~ renewed belief
