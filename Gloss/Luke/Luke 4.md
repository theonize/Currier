Luke 4


Jesus faith, hope, and love are tested


3) The physical is an incomplete representation of man's need [Php 3:19]

4) There is nothing secular before His throne


6) 'for it has been delivered to me'
	God has allowed Lucifer to possess all authority and glory of the Earth
	Jesus does not challenge this possession!  But, He will come back to undo it.


12) [Deut 6:13]


[Dan 9:27] ~ _wing of abomination_ hints at a pinnacle (an architectural term)


17) Jesus quotes [IS 61:] **but** leaves out the _day of vengeance_ ~ this ommission is the abstenscion for the Church era
	some of the terms used are in [PS 82], as in [JOHN ?]

	this was likely the Jubilee year


25) [1Kgs 7:17]


28) They were angry because he was preaching salvation for Gentiles.


41) Jesus did not want the testimony of demons
