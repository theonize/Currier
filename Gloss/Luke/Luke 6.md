# Luke 6


[Deut 23] ~ passerby feeding

Sunday is not Shabbat

Shabbat was made for man, not man for Shabbat

11) Jesus was phenomenally merciful towards sinners who came to Him.
However, He vituperatively humiliated the religious leaders.

12) ALL NIGHT prayer by the LORD...


Path to happiness (also evidences of salvation)
- faith in God
- love toward others
- honesty
- obedience to God


20) [Prov 30:8-9]
[Is 61] [Luke 4:18]


No one is recorded to have died in Christ's presence.

Attitudes toward: others, ourselves, God.
[Prov 30]


[Ps 42]


27) Who are God's enemies?  Us.
[Rom 8:5]


36) Be merciful
Judgmentalism by humans is typically just a pleasuring sport.

_magnanimous_
[Ps 135:18] ...who do you want to be like?


37-38) Giving & Receiving
  judgment
  condemnation
  forgiveness
  ...giving (or not giving) these directly relates to the blessing we receive
  - lack of judgment of others means lack of judgment against us
  - lack of condemnation of others means lack of condemnation of us
  - forgiveness of others means forgiveness of us
  ...here, on Earth, and after

  Does this law apply to all gifts? specifically, financial gifts?
  We think so because Jesus generalizes it in v38 "give and you will receive";
  and there are many passages that link giving to receiving.
  - [Prov 11:24-25] is one example amongst Proverbs
  - [Malachi 3] is another
  
  However, its important to note that Jesus does not make the explicit connection to money.
  He prioritizes the redemptive acts that we should take.
  The following parable illuminate the point.

39-40) Following the importance of giving grace, and giving in general, we have a parable about leadership.
  Jesus admonishes us to not lead others into folly.
  The way to avoid "falling in the ditch" is to take off the blinders.
  Referencing back to His teaching: what blinds us is judgment, condemnation, and unforgiveness of others.
  Teaching the next generation to be this way is anathema to the Kingdom of God.

41-42) What's it like to have a log in your eye?
  You probably can't see well [blindness] and probably can't move around without wacking others and hurting your neck.
  We shouldn't expend even an ounce of energy on others' faults until we have purged our own.



43-45) You can tell a person's _leaning_ by how they speak.
Interesting that everyone has treasure:
What makes treasure good or evil?  _thesauros_ means a container of treasure; i.e. the chest with the gold.
  "the abundance of the heart" ~ implying every heart is filled with something?  at least, every heart that speaks is filled...


46) [Ps 115:8]


Judas Iscariot ~ Ahitophel
...betrayal + suicide
