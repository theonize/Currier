Luke 23


26-31) During His darkest day, in a brief reprieve, Jesus takes the opportunity to lift the despairing followers.


31) Green wood is no longer a valid part of the plant, neither is it good for kindling.  The destitute exist interstitially between useful states- the fold of a loving chiasm.


34) God's attitude towards humanity is summed in this verse.


44-49) Responses to the cross
  44-45.  The Father grieved
  46. Christ enacts
  47. The mystic is amazed - and testified
  48. The scornful beat their chests - and left
  49. The disciple is distant - and left
