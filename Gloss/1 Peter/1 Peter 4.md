1 Peter 4


1-6) Part of the reason for suffering is to separate us from our sin.
The "surprise" of no longer running with your old acquaintances, in your old behaviors, is an in-road to preach the gospel.
"They now live" ~ there is a legacy of every person.
i.e. "honor your father/mother" doesn't end with death; we all live "in spirit" beyond our current timespace via influence of others.


7) sober-minded ~ sophroneo ~ sound judgment, clear headed;
This is an understanding that YOU are the enemy and the world _is_ doing everything to isolate you and weaken your testimony.
[Matt 24:12]()
[Rev 2:4-5]()
Pragmatism ~ a necessary preclusion of things inhibiting our prayer life.


10) A gift is a responsibility, it must be utilized in service; this use is a primary stewardship.


11) two categories of gifts: speaking and serving
The end of all acts is glory to God.


12-19) Trials are often incurred by congregations.

12) Why be alarmed at trial/suffering? it is not unusual for us...

14) Insults beget blessings because that is God's nature- to care for His children in their suffering.

15-16) There is shame in lawful punishment but not in the unlawful.


17) Judgment begins with believers...at a certain point only the unfaithful are left to be judged.
A rhetorical question to which the answer is in the next verse.

18) Those who do not obey the gospel will not be saved.
