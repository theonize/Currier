1 Peter 1


1)
elect = chosen
exiles = moved out on purpose
Dispersion = !capitalized!
	dispersed from what?
	dispersed for why?

Pontus = south shore of Black Sea
Galatia = north-central Turkey
Cappadocia = south-central Turkey
Asia = western Turkey, southern Bosphorus Strait
Bithynia = west-south of Black Sea on northern Bosphorus Strait


A common sentiment is "foreknowledge" and "predestination"; calling and election fall into this vein.  Remember that such things deal with time, so they are only interesting to those of us in time.
	God's understanding of the future is not because He predicts what's going to happen.  He just knows what's happening in all of time.


2)	by God's foreknowledge
	= predetermination
	= deliberate
	= destiny
	for 3 reasons:
		1. sanctification, set apart
		2. teaches obedience
		3. "sprinkling with His blood" ~ a reminder of the covenant


There is a frequent pattern of referring to silver and gold as "perishable" even though their usage as currency was for the reason that they (especially gold) did not corrode [though silver does corrode it doesn't fall apart like iron].
	The intention is to remind that even gold can be rubbed away (or sink to the bottom of the ocean.)  God's measures go beyond even the most enduring things in the world; i.e. gold

These lengthy, run-on sentences were considered the height of Greek authorship/oratory.


3-9) There is the unspoken example of Jesus' suffering here.  Jesus suffered, then died, then was resurrected;  We suffer, will die, then...


3) living hope
	Blessed ~ eulegemenos ~ interesting root; eulogy is, similarly, a study of the blessings of a human life.
	...also interesting to note that, in Hebrew "bless" is __barak__ ~ "kneel"

	Also note that the "blessed be" intro jives with Paul ~ it was an apostolic distinctive; i.e. the members would know sacred when they heard it.

	mercy is not getting the wrath/separation you deserve

	new birth

	resurrection ~ the sacrifice was important, the resurrection moreso [1Cor 15]()

4) 
	imperishable
	undefiled
	unfading

	kept in heaven ~ because holy things are with God, cannot be on Earth.


5) being guarded by God's power ~ protected for _something_
		...power ~ dynamis; i.e. dynamic movement
		
	"through faith" ~ note that it doesn't say God's faith, or our faith, just then general effort of faith

	_something_ is "a" salvation; not personal salvation, but that which is had in the end-times (eschatos)
		NOT "Your Best Life Now" ~ for the believer, this is the worst it will ever get, for the non-believer, this is the best it will ever get.

	"last time" ~ eschatos kairos ~ ending season

	[Eph 2:8-9]()


6) "you rejoice" this is basic belief such that all believers ahare this joy 

	"if necessary" ~ trials always have a reason: growing us, moving us, etc.
	"various" ~ we do indeed see a variety of suffering


7) refinement is a common theme in the Bible

	praise ~ approval
	glory ~ distinction
	honor ~ value
	...at The Revelation


8) unseen past
	 unseen present
	 joy for the futur

 receiving ~ as in NOW
 "the goal of your faith" === salvation of my soul
 salvation ~ __soterion__ ~ health, as in nursed back to health, delivered to healthfulness


9) [Hebrews 12:1-2]


10-12) Inspiration
			 The bulk of OT was devoted to the future...redemption

The prophets searched & investigated, wanting to discover the grace that the Church has.
	They wanted to when and where Christ would come.
	Instead the revelation was that it was for later generations, and it was their service to present it.
	The culmination is the Spirit preaching the gospel through the Church.
	"angels long to catch a glimpse of these things"
	 ~ we can just imagine the heavenly angels waiting with astonishment
	 ~ while the fallen angels are continually terrified as the plan unfolds


13-22) Holy Living: being transformed for good and transforming others
	Again we have talk of things less perishable than gold and the the foreknowledge of God; this is a chiastic, book-end ending of the opening stanza.

13) preparation and separation is key:
	~ we have to prepare for the unknown
	~ we have to refrain from unhealthy things

	"set your hope" ~ means hoping only in God's plan
	...which is the grace come the final revelation

14-16) In obedience we must be holy ~ this means there is an act on our part to set ourselves apart from the world.

	"Be holy as I am holy" ~ this comes in two parts: the regeneration of God [in us] and us being set apart from the world in what we _do_ and what we _think_.

14) "former" ~ after salvation begins we have no excuse; ignorace of the law is no excuse, especially when we have the conviction of the Holy Spirit pressing us toward God's ways.


17) IF you appeal to God ~ if you claim to be His child then you must know:
	~ He judges impartally
	~ He judges according to works

	In light of that we should "conduct yourselves in reverence" ~ do everything with that constant understanding that God behind every corner

	"living as strangers" ~ we are sojourners, just passing through
	...however, while we are here we are expected to be ambassadors and recruiters

18) you were redeemed from your empty way of life
	~ true for the Chaldean, Abraham, who was set apart physically and spiritually
	~ true for us who are surrounded with the distractions of post-christendom

-19) we were not ransomed with money but something more valuable and enduring: the blood of the pure sacrifice: Jesus.
	Its always interesting that blood- messy, sticky, stinky- represents the purity.  It is a truly idealistic view of the fluid; cleanliness through carnage, victory through slauhter is quite a sobering necessity.

20) "last times" ~ eschatos chronos ~ these current days
	...for YOU

21) "so that" ~=  belief ~ obedience ~ purity ~ brotherly love
	"imperishable" seed ~ the Word of God
	...this is quite literally, obviously true: we have more scripture today than Peter did; more than any reformation father did.
