# Galatians 5

1) once free we must willingly yield to the slavery of sin


16-

19-24) which of the fruits evidenced in your life

19-21) works of the flesh; anti-spirit behaviours
  The Harlot ~ sexual addicts
  The Rebel ~ immoral rejection of authority
  The Bohemian ~ pleasure seekers
  The Power Seeker ~ promote personal gain
  The Escape Addict ~ drug addict
  The Professional Victim ~ hate and antagonism
  The Drama Lover ~ love controversy and chaos
  The Competitor ~ antagonistic, contentious rivals
  The Volcano ~ consistent, passionate rage
  The Ladder Climber ~ politicking and electioneering
  The Revolutionary ~ habitually inciting rebellion
  The Watchman ~ causes divisions and dissensions
  The Materialist ~ covetous in action, selfish
  The Alcoholic ~ habitual intoxication
  The Party Animal ~ habitual partiers


22-24) fruit of the Spirit
	as B.R. points out - it is singular, there is one fruit; fruits are those who come after

22)
	love
	joy
	peace
	patience
	kindness
	goodness
	faithfulness

  [John 8:29]() ~ closeness with God equates to being Spirit-filled which equates to these fruit

23)
	gentleness
	self-control

	lawfulness

24) don't forget the penultimate fruit - crucifying the passions and desires of the flesh
	passions = driving motivations that fuel us; like a raging bull we devote ourselves in singular focus to achieving our goals and partaking of whatever we will
	desires = our desires (as opposed to His); these cannot ever, on this Earth, be in agreement; we must put off our desires, hence John's proclamation {Jn 3:30}


25) Living is being "saved"; Following is deliberate and intentional
