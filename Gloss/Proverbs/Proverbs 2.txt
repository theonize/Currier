Proverbs 2

1) "if you accept" ~ the first step is desire


4) seek it like silver ~ what is it about silver mining?
Dig up ore, crush and separate, smelt, refine.
We should be about mining and not prospecting (always searching for new claims). 

5) understand fear, without fear of the LORD there can be no faith
  without fear there is no courage


7) store = ???? ~ hide away, keep safe.  God saves wisdom for the elect.


16-19) Interesting that this woman to avoid is married with children.  Not condoning pre-marital sex: but the ancient definition of adultery was sex with a married/betrothed woman.
