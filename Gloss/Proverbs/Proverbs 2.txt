Proverbs 2

The If-Yous:
* accept the word
* "store up", preserve the word
* direct, point yourself toward the word
* call out, ask for, insight
* lift your voice, speak the word
* search for the word

Then...
* God gives wisdom which protects us and keeps us on the straight & narrow path


1) "if you accept" ~ the first step is desire


4) seek it like silver ~ what is it about silver mining?
Dig up ore, crush and separate, smelt, refine.
We should be about mining and not prospecting (always searching for new claims). 

5) understand fear, without fear of the LORD there can be no faith
  without fear there is no courage


7) store = ???? ~ hide away, keep safe.  God saves wisdom for the elect.


16-19) There are indications that this woman to avoid is married with children.
It is also a generalizations, maybe even an anthropomorphism of a sexual sin shade stalking saints.
Not condoning pre-marital sex: but the ancient definition of adultery was sex with a married/betrothed woman.
The two are distinct and have differing consequences.
