# Proverbs 19


5,9) False witness, like Naboth's accusers, will suffer
  Liars will cannot escape their own snare, neither can they live in the end.
  
  
7) People hate the poor and needy, thank God that He does not!
We are all poor and needy in spirit.


9) 


10) We can run "into" His name by invoking it and {Ex 21:7} standing under it


18) God knows how many stumbles it will take us to walk right
  {Deut 21:18+} - we rebels deserved death, but He pardoned us
  Thank God for His discipline.

19) This is especially important for someone being groomed toward leadership: we are no longer servants of Christ upon salvation, we are brothers.  [John 15:15]()
  A brother and friend __can__be disciplined by words because the heart is involved and emotion cements the lesson.

22) what does it take to be a real man?  steadfast love

23) fear of God = rest and satisfaction 
  ...we feel the hand and try to see the face
  ...no harm to those who fear the LORD?  Now?


30) rebuke is like hydrogen-peroxide, it destroys rotten and foreign flesh
  {Heb 12:11}
