Proverbs 27


2) never sing your own praises
  of a stranger praises you he sees true value, even if selfishly


13) like the garment of the house of Judah was held... Only God could redeem it.


17) when two same metals engage they both wear the same, the goal is shape not material change

19) we can know ourselves, to an extent, by our heart
  the implication is that we can know others
  {Ex 23:19} - be merciful to a brother and wary of a hypocrite


21) a person is tested by their game ~ is Apollo about perception, do they realize where it comes from?
