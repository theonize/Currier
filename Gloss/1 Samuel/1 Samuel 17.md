# 1 Samuel 17

I wonder how many of David's future cohort, his mighty men, were cowering in the camp prior to this fight.


4-7) Goliath was both a physical and a technological marvel.

4) Champion ~ a'sh_hbnim, the man between the two


8) "Am I not a Philistine?". Am I not your and your God's enemy?
The world does continually, loudly mock the gospel and Scripture.


11) "dismayed" ~ afraid of what might be

12-14) it's possible that David had a different mother than the older brothers


25) "free in Israel" means free from taxes


David gives theology lessons to his brothers, his king, his nation, and his enemy.


34-36) David's combat resume


37) David begins by understanding Yahweh's setup; he ends with a natural conclusion based on the circumstances _created by Yahweh_.
David understands and receives God's faithfulness through grace - progressive growth [Eph 2:8].

38) Perhaps Saul thought to gain recognition by having his armour visible; perhaps he truly thought he was helping David; perhaps he just didn't know better.  Perhaps it was all of these.

38-39) clothing another in your own armor is anathema, we must don God-given armor [Eph 6]()

40) He took five stones... Goliath had 4 brothers: Lahmi, Ishbibenob, Saph, and an unnamed


51) David used the enemy's weapon against him.


54) He took Goliath's head to Jerusalem, which was not controlled by Israel but by the Jebusites
