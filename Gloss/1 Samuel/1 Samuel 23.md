1 Samuel 23


Word comes to David that Philistines are attacking Keilah.
David prayed, asking Yahweh if he should attack "these" Philistines.
Yahweh says "Yes."
David's men balk: they are too afraid.
David asked God again.
Yahweh, again, says "Yes."
So, they go and win the fight.

David asks God if Saul will attack him.
Yahweh says, "Yes."
David asks if the people in Keilah will give him up.
Yahweh says, "Yes."
