Psalm 22

The power of this prayer is in the naming of circumstances and conditions.
..."makes them visible for remedy" Kathleen O'Connor


1-19) Lament and recount ~ raw emotion

3) Yahweh dwells in the fruit of our lips - lives of praise


12) ~ the leaders of the realms of the dead (Bashan)


19) We make it over halfway through the song before a request is made.

19-21) Requests:
- Come
- Deliver
- Save


26) Seekers are not rewarded with answers but with joy.


29) Every knee will bow [Is 45:23](Is 45:23)


The psalmist is assuming that God knows what to do 


Jesus quotes this psalm from the cross - not as a prophetic fulfillment but as a paradoxical identification with we who suffer.
