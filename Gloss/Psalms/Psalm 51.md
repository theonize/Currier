Psalm 51


8) this may have been an inspired addition seeing that the walls didn't need rebuilding until after the exile.


12) This is grace: that we are not caused to do a thing but given the means to do a thing.  Notice that a willing Spirit is before a Spirit of power: without willingness there can be no power.  

13) This is how we validate a ministry: does is reach and teach the lost.
