# Psalm 1

1) Body positioning is important.


Interesting symettry:

1,3)
1.walk - 2.yielding fruit
2.stand - 1.planted
3.sit - 3.prosper

Righteous path:
1. Be planted and stand
    a. Where you are right now.  A tree really can't move itself.  God puts it near a nutrient source.
    b. In the shape you are in
2. Yield fruit
    a. Not creating but purposely allowing, the sense of timing based on properties
    b. Not prematurely, having patience
    c. Not late, when the ripeness is gone
3. Leaf unwithering
    a. The leaf can't cause itself not to wither: it is totaly dependent on the branch, thereby the trunk [vine]. [John 15:5]
