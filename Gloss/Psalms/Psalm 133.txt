Psalm 133


'brothers' is first used of Abraham and Lot

quarreling amongst family is a given and is seen throughout the Bible


{1Chr 12:38}
  perhaps the event inspiring this Psalm


Our truest example of unity is the Trinity
  {John 17}


1) brothers ~ genetic and spiritual
two unities ~ 
  factual ~ members together in the Church
  practical ~ no gossip, no retreat
good ~ echoes of the sixth day {Gen 1}
pleasant ~ enjoying the shared Spirit

2) {Ex 30:22,31} holy anointing oil
  ~ used for consecration
The priest is saturated with the holy stuff
...so, unity is like being showered in holiness

3) Mt. Hermon, tall and far too the north, the source of life-giving waters
Yahweh has commanded the blessing of unity
~ give it = share your gifts
~ receive it = invest time

{Php 2:1}
