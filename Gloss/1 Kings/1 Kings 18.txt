1 Kings 18


30) Was this a valid altar?
What made this a valid sacrifice?
It must have been the Spirit in which it was given.


31) The representative altar would be built up by man and *completely* consumed by God.


33) Remember that they are in the midst of a 3 year drought.
Water is extremely valuable.


36-37) [John 11:41-42]()
A miracle for the benefit of the onlooker.


38-39) The people didn't have to do anything to cause God to act.
The amount of energy required to consume the stone and dust ?should? have consumed some onlookers.


41) Elijah prayed with his head between his knees
