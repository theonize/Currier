1 Kings 19.txt

1-5) Elijah wanted to die...as he was running from someone who wanted to kill him.

4) "I have had enough!"

5) Yehovah's messenger came, counter to Jezebel's, commanding action and nourishment

11) "He said" ~ who?  Was it God or Elijah talking to himself?

11-12) God was not _in_ the storms; though He is the Master of them.  [Mark 4][Luke 8][Matt 8]

perhaps this is the normative approach of Yahweh: hurricane, earthquake, fire, calm.

11) Stand, passby, wind, quake, fire, whisper.
Stand - because he had run and hid
Passby - Yehovah passed by
Ruach ~ wind/spirit/breath, the most descriptive effect
Ra'ash ~ quake/rush/commotion
Aysh ~ fire/burning
{Mark 4:39} - the power to calm the storm is scarier than the storm itself.


15) God didn't answer Elijah directly.

15-16) God's plan revealed
A. Goto Damascus
B. Anoint Hazael king of Syria
C. Anoint Jehu king of Israel
D. Anoint Elisha prophet

17) {Rom 13:1} {2Pet 2:13}
