# Ephesians 6


2) The 5th commandment


The armor is also in [Is 52:7] [Is 59:17]

The components of the armor are both blessings given by God and virtues that we attain.
  salvation - given by God for our loyal belief
  righteous - right is defined by God and practiced by us
  truth - the nature of God that we mine
  faith - empowered by God we can act
  spirit - our nature bolstered by the Holy Spirit
  gospel - the message we speak is written by God

11) "the whole armor" How often do we pick only certain pieces of the armor?
  truth
  righteousness
  gospel
  faith
  salvation
  word


12) [Col 1:16]


15) a soldier's shoes are lugged or cleated


18-20) The Church is not a hospice for those awaiting heaven, it is an enabler for Kingdom work.
