# Ephesian 1:15-22

The nature of experience.


## History / Culture

The Church in Ephesus, like the world around them, was largely illiterate.
Even in the city it was a largely agrarian population along with many tradespeople.
Thus, we see Paul's recognition of this: God gave them wisdom and knowledge.
And these were given to bolster their existing faith and hearing of the gospel from Paul.
It is interesting that the raising from the dead and head/body imagery spans cultures so readily.
Also, interesting to note that these were a persecuted people: they were under the auspices of the Roman Caesar and the occassional reprobate governor.
So, a reiteration of the power of Christ over all authorities would be a great encouragement to them.


## Language

Giving thanks, while mentioning you...that;  the end of Paul's prayer(s) for the Ephesians is their wisdom and knowledge and maturity.
Spirit of wisdom; why must wisdom be spiritual?  It's enough for me to say that it is and leave it there.  
However, educated idiots (of which I am one) will also balk at the idea that wisdom is a higher thing.
Biblically speaking wisdom is discernment and the ability to put knowledge  into practice.
- discernement is seeing the truth behind a matter
- practice is the correct, timely application of knowledge

These two phrases are identicalized: "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ" and "the Father of glory".
- it's not too much of a linguistic stretch to unite God/Father as well as LJC/glory
- however, it seems a little stretchy to say that Jesus "had a God"; so, the phrase "God of" is more likely meaning "the God part of" LJC.  This fits nicer with the "of glory"- Yahweh is the God __of__ LJC; LJC is the glory __of__ the Father (Yahweh).
- this is more than just a semantic diversion: it is an important bolstering of the multi-nature of God to these Hellenic people.  It has become a common expression for missionaries to present the gospel in terms of the locals' understanding and then show how He is the better version of it.


For this reason I too,
  having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints,
    do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers:
      that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
        may give to you the Spirit of wisdom 
        and of revelation in the full knowledge of Him,
        so that youâ€”
          the eyes of your heart having been enlightened
        -will know what is the hope of His calling,
        what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
        and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who 
          believe according to the working of the might of His strength,
            which He worked in Christ,
              by raising Him from the dead 
              and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,
                far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,
                and every name that is named,
              not only in this age but also in the one to come.
            And HE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET,
            and gave Him as head over all things to the church,
              which is His body,
              the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
