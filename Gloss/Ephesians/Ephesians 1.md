## Greeting
History
  The world at large was mostly illiterate and non-christian at this time.
	Though the way was rapidly gaining trodders it was brand new to all.
	Thus, there was no plethora of scriptures and teachers to be found.
	The best they could do was converted Jews and itinerant preachers such as Paul.
Culture
	Ephesus was a hellenic university town under Roman rule.
	Polytheism was the order of the day, slavery was the norm, and persecution was on the rise.
Language
	- Paul ~ he was known to them, having inhabited the city and been popularized while there.
	- apostle ~ an envoy, not a concept foreign to their religion...a sort of higher echelon professional priesthood.  Particularly important in the earliest church days because they had no written canon beyond the Jewish scriptures.  They were the living New Testament, in a sense.
	- Christ Jesus ~ He was known to them through Paul's preaching.  Christ is messiah, only beneficial to those who understand a need for one.  Jesus is the man, somehow God as well as flesh.  Neither was this concept foreign to them...but the particulars of the message were: free salvation underrowed only by the works of God.
	- by God's will ~ a necessary addendum for those who may doubt; only time (and works such as the Ephesus church plant) could reveal the authenticity of Paul's commission.
	- saints and faithful ~ literally: "holy-ones who're in Ephesus and believing in Christ Jesus".  Holy-ones takes us back to OT references, QDV$|qadesh; this is used to describe God's self and those he redeems.  Something is holy when it is set apart.  Naturally, we who believe are set apart (weird, strange, foreign (and saved.))
	- grace, peace ~ not idle words: the free gift of salvation is gracious but comes at the cost of belief [something higher than self].  God made peace with us by paying our ransom so we could live at peace with Him.  "I was under your wrath but through the cross I'm reconciled."
	- God our Father ~ the concept of fatherhood seems quite difficult to understand as it is a main point under assault throughout the ages.  We can trust that the exemplar who is unyielding, strict, stern, and yet goes out of his way to reconcile with us is the only true one.  And let us not miss that this true father is GOD- in this sense a divinity whose consciousness and intelligence far outstrips ours.
	- Lord Jesus Christ ~ Jesus the master messiah.  To amplify the previous phrase Paul adds the ideal of mastery and His name and title.  Father-God and Jesus-Christ are book-ends on Lord that showcase divine-flesh connection as well as master-redeemer.


Blessings:
- Quantity
	The urgent often pre-empts the important.
- Quality
- Locality
- Instrumentality

Ironside's Door:
	Imagine you're walking down a hallway and see a door labeled, "Enter whosoever will."  Upon entering you see a banquet table set with only a few places set; one of which has your name at it.
