## Greeting
History
  The world at large was mostly illiterate and non-christian at this time.
	Though the way was rapidly gaining trodders it was brand new to all.
	Thus, there was no plethora of scriptures and teachers to be found.
	The best they could do was converted Jews and itinerant preachers such as Paul.
Culture
	Ephesus was a hellenic university town under Roman rule.
	Polytheism was the order of the day, slavery was the norm, and persecution was on the rise.
Language
	- Paul ~ he was known to them, having inhabited the city and been popularized while there.
	- apostle ~ an envoy, not a concept foreign to their religion...a sort of higher echelon professional priesthood.  Particularly important in the earliest church days because they had no written canon beyond the Jewish scriptures.  They were the living New Testament, in a sense.
	- Christ Jesus ~ He was known to them through Paul's preaching.  Christ is messiah, only beneficial to those who understand a need for one.  Jesus is the man, somehow God as well as flesh.  Neither was this concept foreign to them...but the particulars of the message were: free salvation underrowed only by the works of God.
	- by God's will ~ a necessary addendum for those who may doubt; only time (and works such as the Ephesus church plant) could reveal the authenticity of Paul's commission.
	- saints and faithful ~ literally: "holy-ones who're in Ephesus and believing in Christ Jesus".  Holy-ones takes us back to OT references, QDV$|qadesh; this is used to describe God's self and those he redeems.  Something is holy when it is set apart.  Naturally, we who believe are set apart (weird, strange, foreign (and saved.))
	- grace, peace ~ not idle words: the free gift of salvation is gracious but comes at the cost of belief [something higher than self].  God made peace with us by paying our ransom so we could live at peace with Him.  "I was under your wrath but through the cross I'm reconciled."
	- God our Father ~ the concept of fatherhood seems quite difficult to understand as it is a main point under assault throughout the ages.  We can trust that the exemplar who is unyielding, strict, stern, and yet goes out of his way to reconcile with us is the only true one.  And let us not miss that this true father is GOD- in this sense a divinity whose consciousness and intelligence far outstrips ours.
	- Lord Jesus Christ ~ Jesus the master messiah.  To amplify the previous phrase Paul adds the ideal of mastery and His name and title.  Father-God and Jesus-Christ are book-ends on Lord that showcase divine-flesh connection as well as master-redeemer.


## Blessings

History
	The idea of God containing and originating all blessings is fraught with complications.
	Most notably: how is man to attain these blessings and at what cost?
	Ultimately divine blessings come at an extremely hight cost, one which mortals cannot pay.
	However, it is not in the character of the Hebraic God to give a free gift.
	Thus, we have the redemption plan: blessings made manifest and available "in Christ"- meaning that price has been paid by His sacrifice.
	Here, Paul links the general blessings of being associated with God to the specific path God established for us to attain them.
Culture
	The notion of godly/divine blessing was not foreign to the Ephesians.
	However, sacrifice (to their gods) was an appeasement and some kind of moral works were necessary too attain divine blessings.
	But wait: even beyond the correllary sacrifice->blessing, which is now free because of Christs' work, there is an inheritance.
	This goes well beyond the religious notions of the day.
Language
	Blessing ~ `eulogew` from whence we derive eulogy; the blessing of knowing or accompanying someone.  We "give" these at a funeral service in grateful remembrance.  God __is__ blessed: He is not just the originator but the embodiment of the blessing.  Paul does make the distinction that we receive every "spiritual" blessing.  
	Grace ~ unmerited favor; in this case the two things to follow: redemption & inheritance.
	Redemption ~ `apolutrwsin` the act of buying back.  It literally means "out of ransom";
	Mystery ~ `mystyrion` a secret, or veiled, thing.  The mystery is not that we need redemption nor that God has blessings available.  The mystery is that it is His will: His wise, insightful will to give them.
	Fullness ~ the "fullness of time" has two characters: one is mine, one is creation's.  He wishes to unite with you/I personally, but also wishes for all of us to unite together with Him.  And not humans either, but all of creation.
	Inheritance ~ `eklyrwthymen` to obtain [a portion] by lot.  Biblically, the lot is in the lap of the Lord.  The inherited gift is not "earned" but simply given at the prescribed time.
Meaning
	Such blessings are reserved for sons: those of a proper station.
	Very important to note that the plan has always been: that we should be holy and blameless.
	Blessing, redemption, and inheritance are all subsequent to being holy and blameless.
	The presence and action of the Holy Spirit is a piton which never breaks free.  It is the reminder of what is to come.  Further, is a "guarantee" of that inheritance; i.e. our ticket to obtain our inheritance when the lot falls to us.



Blessings:
- Quantity
	The urgent often pre-empts the important.
- Quality
- Locality
- Instrumentality

Ironside's Door:
	Imagine you're walking down a hallway and see a door labeled, "Enter whosoever will."  Upon entering you see a banquet table set with only a few places set; one of which has your name at it.
