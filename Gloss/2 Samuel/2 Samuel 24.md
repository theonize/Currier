# 2 Samuel 24


1) The anger of God was against the people, not the king in particular. 
   It is the king who becomes the arbiter of God's wrath.
   The significance of the census is many-fold
   - it captures David's desire to measure his military strength
   - it is improper
   - it was a part of David's own succession plan
   There is a corellary in 1 Chr 21 which elaborates that it was a Satan who lit the flame, "and stood Satan..."

2-3) David's counselor's push back: 
   a census is not necessary, God will provide if necessary;
   further, it creates the wrong image of the kingly lineage and of the nations faith in God.

4) The leaders obeyed the king despite their objections.


+) Despite the punishment, the effect of the census would persist.
   The nation expected their strength to be in and rather than God.
   And the establishment of the line of kings was based on human force rather than God.
