# Ruth 4


There were 13 men involved in the town council scene: 10 elders, Boaz, the nearer kinsman, and [spiritually] Elimilech.
* 10 is the quorum for a "synagogue" (or town council) [Deut 23:2]()


[Revelation 5]
[Jeremiah 32:6-15] ~ saving the scroll in a jar of clay for later generations.


6) The means to "ruin my inheritance" is by having foreign influence in his gene-line.
   However, Ruth had proselyted herself (1:16-17) this becoming a Jewess by adoption.

7) [Deut 25:5-10]()

Why would Boaz be comfortable taking a Gentile wife?  His mother was Rahab
* Salmon married Rahab [Joshua 6:25]()
* Boaz's father was Salmon [Matthew 1:5]()
* Perez
  * [Genesis 38:6-29]()
  * [1 Chr 2:5,18,50-54]()
  * 

A toast to Perez, the son of Judah & Tamar.
Tamar, being childless, was redeemed by Judah solicitously.


17+) Taken literally, this puts the events of Ruth at the end of the Judges period. 
     However, it is not theologically necessary for this to be the case- Biblical genealogies often have gaps.
     The important aspect here is the lineage and they key figures therein. 


Perhaps the family bonds with Moab continued because David was able to goto the King of Moab for help in 1 Samuel 22:3-4.


Bethlehem ~ [Micah 5:2], the birthplace of the Messiah.


Typologically:
* Boaz is the redeemer/christ
  * Boaz waited for Ruth to make a move
  * ...then he steps in and takes charge to redeem her (quite shrewdly)
* Naomi is Israel
  * Naomi teaches Ruth about the redeemer and how to interact with him ~ Jewishness
* Ruth is the Church
  * Naomi meets Boaz, the redeemer, through Ruth
