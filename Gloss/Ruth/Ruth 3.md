# Ruth 3

Threshing ~ the location where winnowing occurs.
Winnowing ~ tossing the grain to separate the chaff and prepare it for market.
  When tossed the heavy grain falls back to the threahing floor while the lightweight chaff (husk, hull) is blown away.

The hem (sheul, crespidon) was the sign of rank.
...cutting off a hem stripped someone of authority
...spreading the "skirt" over someone was a sign of protection, acceptance
[Hem pattern](../../Pattern/Hem.md)

Ruth is propositioning Boaz by submitting to him as a wife.

Boaz is flattered by Ruth's proposition.
- he defers to the law which presupposes her marriage to a nearer kinsman
- he also gives her a substantial gift: 6 measures of barley to Naomi via Ruth
	...the message is that He will not rest until the matter is resolved
	...symbolic of a gift to the Jews via the Church


The city gate is analogous to _City Hall_ - the seat of power
- Boaz was a city official 

10 men as witness (10 = the number of witness)
- Go'el = kinsman redeemer; this is the role of Boaz
- there was a problem whereby the nearer kinsman was not able to redeem the land

The Torah expressly forbade men marrying Moab women
- Boaz was the "son" of Rahab

Similitude
- Ruth had to have the volition to submit herself to marriage
- Boaz was not only the redeemer but completed the entire process _alone_ ~ the entirety of the work was his.


1) An arranged marriage...by the mother.


12) What is the symbolism here?
    Boaz is a Jew but must legally defer to another kinsman. 
    That other kinsman is also Jewish but uninterested in the redemption of Elimilech's line via a gentile.
