# Ruth 2

The Law of Gleaning:

- Leviticus 19:9-10
- Deuteronomy 24:20-21
- owner may make one pass to collect crops, the rest was left for the poor and sojourners

Boaz, the _Lord of the harvest_, shows grace toward Ruth personally and via his servants.


4) Boaz has an excellent rapport with his servants.
  This is our indication of Boaz' righteous character.


12) "The LORD repay you" ~ the grace of the believer is attributed to Yahweh.
  "Under whose wings" ~ Good provides they venue and we act within it.


14) Boaz serves Ruth bread & wine.
  To "dip the morsel" together was a sacrament.
  Recall that Jesus dipped bread with his disciples- in a sense officially enjoying them to do what they would (of course 1 went a salacious direction.)


17) an ephah is approximately 6gal of seed.
  This amount of grain is an blessing but imagine a girl carrying a huge basket of grain back home.


19-23) Naomi recognizes Boaz's interest and coaches Ruth in that direction.

20) "The man is a close relative of **ours**" ~ Naomi still conaiders Ruth a daughter.
