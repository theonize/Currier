# Ruth 1

The daughters looked to Naomi for their salvation.

The beginning of the barley harvest.

2-4) Moab especially was off limits to the Israelites because of her incestuous beginning (between Lot and his daughters; 
Genesis 19:30-38), the Moabite’s repeated refusal to help Israel in times of peril (Numbers 22-24), the Moabite women’s’ seduction of the Israelite men (Numbers 25), God’s explicit prohibition of the Moabites from the assembly of the LORD (for 10 generations; 400 years) (Deuteronomy 23:3), and Moab’s false gods (Judges 10:6). 
Nevertheless, Elimelech led his family there and his sons took wives there. 
They took matters into their own hands and paid the steepest price.
  The death of the men was not God's retribution but it may well have been a consequence of their going to a forbidden place.
It is certainly allegorical for the family leadership abandoning the Church because of it's vapidness.
...the correct response would have been to wait and trust in God and see the tangible affect of righteousness. 

3-4) The men did not take Moabitesses until after dad died- 
Elimelech may have prevented it but he also placed them in a situation where they were inclined to depart from their traditional regulations. 


20-22) Naomi declares that she has "returned empty" which is not true- she had Ruth with her.
But Ruth is faithful nonetheless. 
Spoiler alert: at the end of story Naomi is made to realize Ruth's value, Ruth 4:15.
