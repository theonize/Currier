1 Timothy 6


4-5) There is an implication here that there is a healthy level of questioning and debate:
  service instead of envy
  unity instead of strife 
  edification instead of reviling
  goodwill instead of suspicions
  collaboration instead of friction


6) great gain ~ measureless gain beyond materiel
	godliness ~ [2Pet 1:5-7]
	contentment ~ [Php 4:11-13]

  The Lord may provide financial contentment as well as goodwill and peace.  We should not be surprised when a skilled teacher is well compensated.  The surprise is that the selfish teacher leaves any good works in their wake.

7) materiel is temporary for the benefit of Kingdom work
8) food/clothing [Matt 6:31]
	= contentment, He provides all our needs (even many wants)

11-12)   {Luke 17:14} - action is required though combat is disorienting
  flee - φευγε - passionately move away from depravity
  pursue - διωκε - don't forget the goal
  fight - αγονιζομαι - strive, agonize
  hold - επιλαβου - take, possess

13) Jesus' confession to Pilate ~ John 18:36-37
