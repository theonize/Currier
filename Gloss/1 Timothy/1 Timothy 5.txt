# 1 Timothy 5

The 1st century Greco-Roman world shared many issues with us. 
Among them, the abandonment of the elderly.

1-2) The provision is to have properly respectful relationships with all people.
  Purity toward brother, sister, and mother is necessary or else these become vassals, enemies, adulteresses.
  An impure relationship with a male peer makes him a partner in crime or an enemy.
  An impure relationship with a female peer objectifies her.
  Likewise with an older woman, not to mention she is easy to cast off.


8) provide is future tense: father's need to give their children a future


17-25) Double honor / double accountability
  The home leader is accountable to his family and to God.
  A leader of a public institution is accountable to all who are affected by his decisions.
  The further honor of this public service is remuneration and accolades.
  It **is** possible to be a Biblically principled leader and make a good living from it.
  But there must be accountability: both public and private.

21) Prejudice goes two ways: both in presuming guilt and in presuming innocence.
  This is why young leaders are anathema to a healthy church:
  they are too easily swayed by hubris and intellect.


21) "these things" referred to appointing and relating with male & female elders
