1 Timothy 3


1) this ambition is good, however it must be understood what the office is

2) the attributes, all past tense, as in, previously learned and portrayed behaviors
  above reproach ~ no unrepentant sin
  one wife ~ as per the pattern
  sober-minded ~ divine fear tempered by justification
  respectable ~ as a representative (2nd cmdmt)
  self-controlled ~ the hallmark of godliness, only seen for sure within stress
  hospitable ~ not turning any away
  able to teach ~ the only skill mentioned, the rest are all character traits
    its not _a desire_ to teach, but the ability
    ...this is some combination of talent and skill

3) not a drunkard ~ there's an element of social purity here
    mostly this has to do with serving only one master,
	   and not responding to stress via anesthesia.
    Further, if a pastor is to be available for visitation or other in-petwon then he cannot drink because of potential influence upon others.
  not violent ~ i.e. not a bully, beyond that, displaying gentleness;
    unviolence is a tall order for the moral man.
    In fact, there is sometimes a necessity for violence but never Overlording another person.
   	gentleness in a man can only be had via Spirit refreshment
  not quarrelsome ~ not that the godly avoids (or even abhors) conflict but he does not create it
  not a lover of money ~ this is not synonmous with wealth,
    it implies an understand of who really provides.
    We can certainly make and use money but do so without hoarding or being greedy.

4) οικονομιον ~ household ruler, this man understands the rules _as given_ and dispenses them
    with...dignity ~ both in his manner of rule/his bearing,
	  and his understanding of his childrens' Imago Dei
    keeping...submissive ~ submission can be forced,
	  willful submission is both righteous and edifying
5) indeed, a man must not be allowed to rule without demonstrated aptitude in the most private place
	  the implication is that current elders must 'live' with the prospect

6) recent converts may be marked as future leaders
  trials & suffering are evidence of God's proving

7) interesting that disgrace follows disrepute
  it is a snare to seek mans' approval, but it will be had via godliness

8) deacons are the doers, the enacters
  by Stephen's account we know them to be on the front-lines [Acts 7-8]
  dignity ~ true dignity is begotten of your imago dei via unio mystica
  double-tongue ~ lies beget lies, we should only speak the Λογος
  addiction ~ as with elders this indicates a supreme lack of faith
  greed...dishonest ~ this is maximal pride and rejection of thr Maker's provision
    honest gain is good!

9) hold = desiring it %% being inscribed [Jer 31]
  clear conscience ~ understanding his own failure AND the grace applied to him
  dogmatic on the essentials, gracious in all else

10) can we assume deaconship as a prerequisite for eldership?
  an additional qualification
  BUT they must pass the test

11) wives and children bear indelible marks of their householder's tutelage
  dignity ~ again, this must be evident even in outer circles of leadership
  no slander ~ this is a frequent admonition of women because it is a frequent problem
    a woman of careful tongue is a welcome wind
  sober-minded ~ this is to be a characteristic of the marriage as well as of each spouse
  faithful ~ faith is only built by Divine provision in trials
    therefore, faithfulness is evidence of one's irrevocable lust for proximate theosis
  ...notice how character traits and built between and shared by spouses

12) one wife ~ again, not just a social and moral necessity but an establishment of the ecclesiastical pattern
  οικονομιον ~ household ruler, not unique to elders but necessary for all leaders

13) good standing is a blessing and a worthy goal!
  service is a way to grasp God's provision and see His faith disseminated
  Christ is the source of faith [Eph 2:8-9]
