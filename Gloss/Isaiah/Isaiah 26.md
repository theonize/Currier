Isaiah 26


9) my soul yearns...
		layil ~ in the night

19) earth gives birth to the dead
	{1Th 4:16} 'the dead in Christ will rise first'

20) come my people
	{1Th 4:15+}
		1st the dead rise
		all rise together
	{Rev 4:5} ~ the lampstands are in heaven
	1. enter your room {Jn 14:2}
	2. shut the door
	3. hide yourselves 
	...until the fury passes
	{Zeph 2:3} ~ perhaps _you_ may be hidden in the tribulation
		you = the righteous & humble
	These 3 elements reflect Noah's flood remnant
     They may also foreshadow a rapture- a hiding of God's people during the tribulation

21) the coming conqueror
