Isaiah 14


Satan's authority ~ {Luke 4}

Spiritual warfare ~ {Daniel 9} (fast, Prince of Persia struggle)

{Eph 6}
	'be strong' ~ you is if you are by 'His might'
	it is the LORD's doing, His armor
	flaming darts = accussations


4) mashal ~ comparative parable


9) The dead are interactive.


21) Urbanity is a symbol of control of the land.  Some translations say "their cities" implying that there is a distinction.  Could also be urbanism insofar as it contradicts nature.
