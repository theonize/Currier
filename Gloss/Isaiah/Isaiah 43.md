Isaiah 43


1-7) He provides as proof of his entitlwmwnt as Lord- the fact the he ransomed/redeemed us.
     And it was not a meager ransom: but the exchange of the greatest nations on earth.
     Further, He promises tribulation and it's conquering.
     Not only will He bring others to walk with us but he Himself walks beside us.


1) we are called by name ~ personally, provincially
"you are mine" paid in full [John 19:30]
  
  
2) "_When_ you pass through" ~ not if,
flood and fire are guaranteed
however, strength to stand up in the waters and immunity to the fire are also guaranteed
   With me in the fire, in the storm, in financial distress, in my hate, in my lust, in my apathy.
   It is our tendency to step away from God until we catch our breath but it is in the most epically hideous darkness that we need him beside us- and He is blessedly willing to come.


4) You[human] are:
   - Precious ~ _'QR_, esteemed, ransom, rare
   - Honored ~ _CBD_, glorious, heavy

  
7) created, formed, and made
