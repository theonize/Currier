2 Corinthians 5

14) died for all, or for all who would believe?  the question of limited atonement which only matters if...


17) _All_ old things are new, dead things are alive.
We are completely remade at salvation, in the eyes of God.

the new has come... for the believer


18) 


21) The implication is: w/o Him we are unrighteous
"He made" ~ God caused Jesus to _become_ sin; it is His plan
... i.e. Jesus went to the cross because that was _God's_ plan
Why? [Rom 6:23] ~ the requirement was a perfect sacrifice

"him" ~ the perfect sacrifice, as testified to by Pilate and the Apostles and others

"to be sin" ~ Jesus did not sin, but He was penalized for our rebellion

"so that" ~ we don't have to foment reconciliation; He does it for us

"we might become" ~ He is the benefactor of His plan

The plan = [Rom 5:8]

[Col 1:12] ~ He has qualified us thusly
...He provides the inheritance and the means for us to be qualified - and the qualifying itself

"become" ~ His righteousness is imputed to us
...our sin was imputed to Him
