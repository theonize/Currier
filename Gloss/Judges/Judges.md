# Judges

A tragedy; good vs. evil
- this style of literature exposes horrible consequences and imbues a desire for something better
  - i.e. there doesn't have to be told a happy ending for the reader to need it, this is the brilliance of the stories
  - i.e. much of the Bible is stories rather than sermons because that is what sticks
  - e.g.
    - Orestes
    - Hamlet, Othello, etc.
- in this sense Judges is prophetic: it gives a pattern of the serious decline before the King rules


Took place roughly 1382-1063BC

Deborah's victory in 1216BC per archaeology @ Hazor

It seems that the events in Judges were not necessarily consecutive.
This is likely because Joshua's conquest happened around 1250BC.


Issues
1. No king in Israel
2. Everyone "did what right in their own eyes"
   1. This language reminds of of the days of Noah
3. God's people can't work together
   1. Christians make their firing squads in circles
4. God's people are in bondage
   1. They HAD conquered the land
   2. The occupation is failed


Structure
0. The Cycle
   1. Sin
   2. Oppression
   3. Repentance
   4. Deliverance
   5. Peace
   - The judges are progressively more unfamiliar with Yahweh
1. Failure to occupy and complete the conquest; Chapters 1 - 2:5
2. Prologue; Chapters 2:6 - 3:6
3. Ehud; Chapter 3
4. Deborah;
5. Barak
6. Jael
7. Gideon
8. Abimelech
9.  Jephthah
10. Samson
11. Dan @ Laish
12. Gibeah
13. Benjamite fratricide


False Gods
1. Ashteroth
2. Astartai


Perennial Pockets of Conflict
- Still today these cities are centers of rebellion against Israel
1. Jerusalem
2. Hebron
3. Jericho
4. Gaza


Technology
- at this time the Philistines had an edge with iron chariots
- later the Israelites would have steel weapons...giving them the edge
