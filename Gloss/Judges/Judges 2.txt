There was no king in Israel.
Everyone did what was right in the their own eyes.

The paradigm:
- immortality
- favor


1) This theophany is a common pattern in the book


4) Everyone _heard_ what the LORD said and wept
  ...however, they seemed not to fully repent


8-10) The faith was not passed on to subsequent generations.
Interesting that Joshua was a tremendous Commander but didn't successfully establish a legacy that would last generations.
Contrast: Ezra & Nehemiah did establish a legacy that lasted centuries.


15-16) "Nevertheless" ~ despite Israel's departure God never let them go

21-23) God left the thorns because of His people's disobedience


[Ps 106]()

The downfall of Israel is a 4-century fade-out
