# Judges 4


[1Cor] ~ the foolishness of God;  Yahweh uses some of the oddest, most unlikely things to save (to showcase His sovereignty)


4-10) God accomplishes His will whether we are compliant or not.
His requirement is that we are presente, attentive, and follow.

Judge Deborah
- Jabin
  - enemy leader 
  - chariots of iron
- Sisera
  - enemy general
- Deborah ~ honey-bee
  - industrious
  - discerning
  - sweet
- Barak
  - heroic general
  - he hesitated and required Deborah to go with him
    - he recognized the value of having a women judge
  - he is listed in the [Heb 11]() hall of faith

The cry is for deliverance, not forgiveness (i.e. no repentance)
The notation of a female judge is derogatory to a patriarchal society


2) Harosheth-haggoyim ~ forest of the gentiles


11,17-23) Jael the Kenite
  - this is the tribe of Moses' father-in-law
  - Heber departed from his tribe, but his wife remained faithful
    - this sets up Sisera's death because he trusted this Kenite even though the wife was loyal to her roots
