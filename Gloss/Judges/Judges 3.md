# Judges 3

We become like what we worship:
- gods are
  - harsh
  - unforgiving
  - greedy
  - defeated
- Yahweh is
  - gracious
  - merciful
  - charitable

Baalim and _the groves_:
  The groves are phallic symbols the represent gods


Judge Othniel
10) the Spirit of the LORD 
    1) the secret of the judges' success
    2) our secret as well

11) 40 years rest ~ 2 generations

12) Evil again


Judge Ehud
15) left-handed (or handicapped w/ his right-hand; i.e. crippled)
    1)  left-handedness was "wrong"; i.e. considered a deficiency
    2)  Judges 20, 1 Chronicles 1 ~ Benjamites were trained ambidextrous
    3) "Benjamin" means son of the right hand;  they had become left-handed assassins


17) Eglon ~ "very fat"
    1)  the knife was two-edged (meant for stabbing) and 1.5' long


21) because Ehud was left-handed the guards didn't search him properly

22) Eglon's diameter was over 18" (cubit) which makes his circumference *at least* 


24) "covereth his feet" means he's defacating


28) after the assassination Ehud gives credit to Yahweh and rallies the troops


Judge Shamgar
31) ox goad ~ 8' long pole with an iron prod on one end and a spade on the other
  [1Sam 13] the enemies always confiscate the weapons
