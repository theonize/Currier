# Jonah 1

Jonah means dove, as in the offering; we get the idea that Jonah is a "good guy", cultural speaking.

Amittai means "my truth"


Fleeing God's presence
- Adam & Eve his from the presence
- Cain left the presence [Gen 4]()
- Satan left God's presence [Job 2]()
- [Ps 139]() ~ can a believer truly leave the presence?

Tarshish
    [1Kgs 10]
    [Jer 10]
    [Ez 27]

    Heroditus said it was beyond the **Pillars of Hercules** = the straits of Gibraltar

Jonah is continually going down; The center of the Earth is the furthest down.


The storm was abnormal ~ it frightened seasoned sailors
...it was terrible enough to make them throw away their livelihood

5) How could Jonah sleep through the storm?  He was anesthetized by his depression.
We get lost in our rebellious way-of-life and ignore life.
We ignore the storms of life; even while our neighbors are throwing their lives away.

The pagan captain called the prophet to account.

Jonah was never forthcoming but waiting for the situation come to a head.

8) Where are you from?  Jonah was out of place

9) Jonah speaks religious truth; but his heart is not with Yahweh.

The sailors come to God through Jonah's ineptitude.

12) Jonah would not commit suicide, he asked to be thrown in.

13) Rowing harder never solves the problem, God solves the problem (v. 15)
  Is 64:6


16) Ironic that the pagan sailors actually feared Yahweh and Jonah did not...though he said so.
