# Jonah 2

Did Jonah die in the fish?
Death seems more likely practice and with the resurrection sign in view.
Also, he prayed from. "the belly of Sheol"

Sign of Jonah
  [Matt 12:39]
  [Matt 16:4]
  [Luke 11:29]
  [Luke 11:30]

  1. The wicked ask for signs.
  2. Only one sign is given to the wicked: resurrection
  3. The wicked = this generation = Nineveh

Historical whale swallowing survivors:
- M.Deparvelle: 1891, James Bartley, Star of the East, Falkland Islands, 
- Harry Rimmer: English sailor, England

1) "From the bowels" ~ after a thousand moral choices that ended in the pit Jonah recognizes his fallenness.
He also recognizes that Yahweh is the answer - we are completely helpless.

1-2) prayed/cried
[Num 11:2]

2-9) vv.2-8 are past tense; vs.9 is present tense

2) Sheol ~ the abode of the dead
[Num 16:30,33] Korah's family went down to Sheol

3) heart of the seas ~ to the ancient mind this was as far away from God as possible - who dwelt atop the _dome of the skies_ that rested on the mountains
Jonah continues his downward path (down into the ship, down into the water, down into Sheol)

4,7) Jonah pines for the temple: he seemed his deep need for holy ground/sacred space.
We have this in the assemblies of the Church.

4) "again look upon" ~ interesting because Jonah was from the Northern kingdom

8-9) Jonah finally realizes his need and the one way to meet that need: Salvation from God

8) Mercy is forfeit via misdirected worship
An idol is a thing, other than Yahweh, that we think will give us security, significance, or acceptance.

9) The sincere desire to sacrifice comes from thankfulness.
