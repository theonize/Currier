# Jonah 2

Did Jonah die in the fish?
Death seems more likely and with the resurrection sign in view it is not infeasible.
Also, he prayed from "the belly of Sheol", the grave.

Sign of Jonah
  [Matt 12:39]
  [Matt 16:4]
  [Luke 11:29]
  [Luke 11:30]

  1. The wicked ask for signs.
  2. Only one sign is given to the wicked: resurrection
  3. The wicked = this generation = Nineveh

- Harry Rimmer: English sailor, England

Per verse 9, this is a prayer of Thanksgiving;  but not one of repentance. This prayer is an aggregation of many quotations from scripture...not his own words.  This is not an indictment: someone who is very attuned to Scripture the to speak thusly.
Later scripture (i.e. Lamentations) draws from this peom
...this implication is two-fold:
  - Jonah knew scripture [very well]
  - Jonah's writing were well known and/or drew from common Jewish sacred language.

1) "From the bowels" ~ after a thousand moral choices that ended in the pit Jonah recognizes his fallenness.
He also recognizes that Yahweh is the answer - we are completely helpless.

1-2) prayed/cried
[Num 11:2]

2-9) vv.2-8 are past tense; vs.9 is present tense

2) Sheol ~ the abode of the dead
[Num 16:30,33] Korah's family went down to Sheol

3) heart of the seas ~ to the ancient mind this was as far away from God as possible - who dwelt atop the _dome of the skies_ that rested on the mountains
Jonah continues his downward path (down into the ship, down into the water, down into Sheol)

4,7) Jonah pines for the temple: he seemed his deep need for holy ground/sacred space.
We have this in the assemblies of the Church.

4) "again look upon" ~ interesting because Jonah was from the Northern kingdom

8-9) Jonah finally realizes his need and the one way to meet that need: Salvation from God

8) Mercy is forfeit via misdirected worship
An idol is a thing, other than Yahweh, that we think will give us security, significance, or acceptance.

9) The sincere desire to sacrifice comes from thankfulness.

[John 13:17]() ~ knowing is not enough, doing is necessary
