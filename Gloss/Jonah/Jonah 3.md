# Jonah 3

I Am Jonah


Jonah did not actually _say_ no to God;
He simply "escaped".
For all his failings: Jonah did hear God and obey (under coercion.)

The Ninevites worshipped Dagon, the fish god.
It is likely that Jonah's time in the fish "marked" him in some recognizable way.
Jonah would have been fishy smelling, bleached, and reputed.
- bleached white from stomach acid
- other fish survivors have similar outcomes

Jonah was racist.
Is denominationalism akin to racism?

God uses rebels and morons to proclaim His word.
...we are all rebellious and simple.
The miracle is not that God hated Esau but that God loved Jacob.

Demolish ~ Nehphket
...more like _transform_ than destroy
...the question is whether the end result of the transformation is good or not.

It's 550 miles from Samaria to Nineveh
- about a month's travel for Jonah
- spec: 40 days?

Such a time as this:
- [Est 4:10+]


1) "second time" ~ many Bible characters were given a second chance: Abraham, Moses, David
...this was the point of Stephen's sermon [Acts 7] which was interrupted by his death.

2) "that great city" this is probably a double reference to:
    a) the might of the kingdom represented by it's capital
    b) the city with it's suburbs (like _greater Houston area_)

3) "arose" ~ in contrast to the going down, down, down of chapters 1-2 he is going up now

4) Jonah never mentions God, nor redemption, in his preaching.
"avyd arbaym yvm vnynvh nhqcH

The Assyrians worshipped the fish god, Dagon.
They were likely impressed by the circumstances of Jonah.
Yahweh proved His superiority.


6) The king, through the Spirit's work, connects the dots based on Jonah's message.
- he descends from pride to humility
- contrast with [chapter 1] Jonah's descent into pride through seclusion

7-10) Sargon preaches a better message then the man of God.
This reaction parallels Ahab's reaction [1Kgs 21:27]()
"sat in ashes" ~ a sort of oneness with Sheol
This is biggest revival known to man.

10) "relented" ~ nacham, Yahweh paused his preparations for destruction;
...in fact He carries those out later
