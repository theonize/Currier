# Revelation 8

Transformation

In Exodus each plague targeted an Egyptian god. 
Similarly, here, the events target our gods 
- Zeph 1:7


30 minutes ~ the awkward, liturgical silence

once again the prayers of saints are offered

"the seven angels"
- we saw 7 angels in ch.1- the messengers to the churches
