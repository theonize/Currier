# Revelation 8

Transformation

In Exodus each plague targeted an Egyptian god. 
Similarly, here, the events target our gods 
- nature
- the seas, sometimes seas represent masses of humanity; also, shipping commerce
- clean water, infrastructure
- science, the heavens, guidance from or calculation from the stars

30 minutes ~ the awkward, liturgical silence
- Zeph 1:7

once again the prayers of saints are offered

"the seven angels"
- we saw 7 angels in ch.1- the messengers to the churches
