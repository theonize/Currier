# John 17

3) know ~ ginyskusin ~ hands-on knowledge


6) Jesus defines the theophany ~ a manifestation of Yahweh's name
  Manifest is more than _making known_ but creating the presence of something or bringing things together through divine means.
  ...interesting because manifestation is such a central theme in sorcery- yet, for God it is simply a matter of will.



[Luke 22]() records that the disciples fell asleep while Jesus was praying, which begs the question- how did they know what he prayer, then?
Obviously it must have be recounted to them by Jesus himself, or by the Holy Spirit, or by some other means.
I think it most likely that he spent His month on Earth [after the resurrection] teaching them such things.

20) This is a prayer for me - and you

21) "one" in nature 
- [1Pet 2:5] we are stones of the temple

22) One: God amongst Hisself __with__ us.  Unity.
