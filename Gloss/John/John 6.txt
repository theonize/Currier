John 6

4-14) Jesus feeds 5000
  the disciple recognized 1) the correct raw materials but 2) incorrect quantities

  barley ~ the grain of there poor, Elijah did a similar (but lesser) miracle.  This also tells us the season.

  Under Moses there were no leftovers [of manna].  Under Jesus there were plenty.  [Deut 18:15]()


7) Philip does the math and sees the shortfall.  We cannot afford to turn people away- even if they starve to death; thankfully God is good and feeds the faithful.


9) interesting that the raw materials were brought by a child
 the child discerned the need
  perhaps the offering was meant just for Jesus and his disciples

10-11) sitting in the grass... grass symbolized the multitudes of sheep, when preparing to receive a gift they sat among the grass

12) "that nothing may be lost"
  disciples are instructed to glean the remainder
  they implication is that the leftovers should be used for purpose and immediately

13) the scraps doubly outnumber the original amount


16-17) interesting how they treat Jesus:
- they went to wait where they had arrived together
- when He doesn't show they takeoff...sure that He'll be fine or just scared and uncaring


22)	They noticed that Jesus left, but not in the boat
23) Why do we need to know this?
24)	they went to City of Comfort, seeking Emmanuel

25)	they found Him across the sea
	~ burial, flow of the Spirit
	...out of the sea = resurrection; across it would be ?rapture?
25b) they didn't know when He went
26) they didn't seek because of an experience but because of the Word
27) Mary/Martha ~ _work_ for the Word, not for food
		food distracts, it embowels us
		doctrine endures to eternal life
		...after which we will stand on the glassy sea/Spirit
	God has sealed Jesus, the foundation [2Tim 2:19]
28) "What must we do?"
		they already 'kept' the Law
29) the answer: believe in Emmanuel
		be an overcomer [Rev 2,3] [1Jn 5:4]
30) now they doubt?!  or the doubters become bold?
		"show us a sign!" the cry of the Sardicean
		"what work?"
			doubting that He believes?
			or, doubting that He keeps that Law?
31) our fathers partook of Manna
	...citing Scripture
32) displacing Moses - they relied on this belief
	'true bread'
33) ~ Elohim Emmanuel
	...gives life (mercy & grace)
34) "Sir" ~ appealing to His (non-existent) pride?
	"give us...always" so demanding...

35) Jesus said, "here I am!"
	come to Him and:
		never hunger ~ fill in our empty doctrine
		never thirst ~ experience God
36) But - you saw and disbelieved
37) those whom the Father gave Him = the called
	...they come automatically
	...He will never release them
38) I Am = Emmanuel
	only to do Yahweh's will
39) = lose nothing He was given
		not only people, but some of creation to be redeemed
	...raise it up on the last day
		out of (from) what?
40) Yahweh's will = everyone who looks on Jesus && believes in Him should have eternal life
	...raise him up on the last day
		out of (from) what?

41) they "grumbled" = evil intent
		because Jesus claimed to be the Word
42) "isn't this the bastard of Increase and Rebellion?" [Ps 69:8]
43) Jesus answered their grumbling
	...don't do it _among yourselves_
		God will hear our grumbling - but bring it to Him
44) no one can come to Him unless called
	calling = drawn
	...raise him up on the last day
45) Word quoting Scripture :)
	...in the Prophets [Is 54:13]
	everyone = all
	...who has heard AND learned
	...comes to Me
46) only Jesus had thus seen the Father
47) whoever believes has eternal life
48) He is the life-saving Word


60-71) The words are spirit and life

The spirit gives life; therefore the words give life and are life.
