# John 20

1) The first day == Sunday
the tomb-stone was "taken away"
she did not investigate but ran to Simon Peter & John


3) Why does he mention that John outran Peter?


5) John saw the burial clothes but did not enter

6) Simon had no problem going in; was it because he knew there was no dead body? or because he didn't care about the law?

7) the head-cloth was folded up ~ ostensibly Jesus removed it and load it aside

8) John believed upon seeing the empty tomb


10-11) The men left but Mary stayed

12) 2 angels at the head & feet are like the mercy seat on the Ark


14-16) perhaps thru her tears, perhaps also because He was disfigured - she didn't recognize Jesus until he spoke her name

17) do not cling __because__ I not yet ascended - why because?
my Father, your Father; my God, your God ~ a message of adoption & inclusion for "the brothers"


19) the disciples still feared retribution

20) A leader known by His scars.


22) was the breath literal/ceremonial? or was it an indication of the transfer of the __pneuma__?

23) the stickiness of forgiveness, or its lack, seems to be a result of being Spirit-filled
We should be confessing to each other, this is encouragement to do that.


27) Jesus showed His scars to the others (v.20) but He offered a touch to Thomas
