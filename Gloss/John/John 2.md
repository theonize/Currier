# John 2

The scope of the temple miracle:
- 10s of thousands of animals
- 10s of thousands of people
- 200-300 temple guards
- Roman oversight, actively watching
...yet took control and was given the authority

God was directing the worship.

This what will happen when Jesus enters the temple: He cleans house.


23-25) They loved what God did, but not Good Hisself
