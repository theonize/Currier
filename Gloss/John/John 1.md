1) re: [prov 8:22-26]()


4) Every created thing has life, though not every created thing is dynamic, and not every dynamic thing is sentient, and not every sentient thing is human.  Thus, he says that light was given to humans~that is, an eternal self.  Further, this light was given, not lent, which carries with it the choice of being with Him or not.


33-34) aren't Church members those on whom the Spirit had fallen and remains?  Are we not, also, sons of God?
  Jesus was the first[fruit] as to the baptism of the Spirit and the baptizing of the Spirit.  We are the successors of the same.
