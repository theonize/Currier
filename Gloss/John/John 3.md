# John 3


Nicodemus represents religious leaders who want Jesus to be the answer.
~ but most parties are opposed to Jesus

Nicodemus approaches Jesus with dignity and honesty.
...this is something sorry lacking from most who approach the throne
...he eventually believed [John 19:39]

2) Nicodemus is coming to Jesus undercover.
Note the analogy of him coming to Jesus through the darkness.
Unlike other Pharisees Nicodemus doesn't ask a question - he has no hostile agenda.
...i.e. hostile could just as easily be "personal"


3) Without a leading question to overcome Jesus can cut straight to the His pet issue: rebirth


11) Who is "we" and "our"?  It must be God & man...all 3 faces of God.


14-18) He mixes tenses here - past, present, and future


14) [Num 21]


16) "God so loved" ~ past tense, since forever ago

perish/life ~ nothing to do with this realm, but a future one

eternal life ~ [John 17:3], starts now


21) Like [Ex 34:29] it is obvious who had been with God


25-30) Sometimes God makes ministries obselete.

31-36) Kind of a revamp of Jesus engagement with Nicodemus.
