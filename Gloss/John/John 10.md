# John 10

1-2) A shepherd _only_ enters through the door
...congregational membership?
Must have sheep to be a shepherd.

3) The gatekeeper opens the door.
Is the gatekeeper the Spirit? or a priest?

The sheep hear the shepherd - this seems to be a Holy Spirit proviso.
The shepherd calls his sheep by name
	This is necessarily personal
	Perhaps this gives a practical limit based on how many names he can coordinate.
The shepherd leads the sheep _out_
...out where?  Perhaps into the pasture (i.e. the Church)

4) The shepherd cont'd:
_When_ he has brought out his flock, all or none...?
He goes before them ~ _leading_.
The flock follows their shepherd.
The sheep know their shepherd's voice
...is this a practiced relationship?  Surely, it must be.

5) The flock:
...will not follow a stranger.
...flees from strangers
...knows their shepherd's voice (reiterated from v.4)
...does not know a stranger's voice

6) The _shepherd_ idiom is declared a spoken *paroimia*
...a proverb, figurative speech


22) dedication...in winter ~ i.e. Hannukah
	~ not a Mosaic feast
	~ an event based on events in the Macabbean revolt
	~ idiomatically future-referred as an important "feast"
	~ incidentally, the time of Jesus' conception


25) Jesus equates _works_ with _telling_
We have such a propensity to say things that are not corroborated by our actions.
