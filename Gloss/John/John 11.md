# John 11


Mary & Martha's appeal was based on their understanding of the Lord's love for them


35) Jesus shows His humanity.  Perhaps he cries because Lazarus had to return from Yahweh's presence.  Perhaps he is overcome by the range of emotions: genuine grief and ceremonial morning.


37) Are they elevating the importance of unblindedness above resurrection?
We might do well to think so...everyone will be resurrected, but not everyone to life with Yahweh.


44) "unbind him" ~ even we, after rebirth, are tangled up in our grave clothes for a time - and this takes an act of God
"let him go" ~ we are recreated to freedom, not into a particular path or mold.
