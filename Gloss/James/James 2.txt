	"The Law" is also presented as a dichotomy to help explain faith & works:
	- The Law ~ refers to the entire composition of scripture and of individual elements in it

	- Faith is Works is Faith ~ i.e. good deeds are evidence of faith which produces good deeds
	- e.g. Hebrews ~ there is similar dichotomy built-up between faith & salvation also
	- There are not [finally] resolvable; you may occassionally resolve such a concept in a finite context but not in general.
