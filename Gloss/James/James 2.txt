	[Heb 9:8-10]

	"The Law" is also presented as a dichotomy to help explain faith & works:
	- The Law ~ refers to the entire composition of scripture and of individual elements in it
- mercy shown to the merciful ~ not a prerequisite work but a condition
	- Faith is Works is Faith ~ i.e. good deeds are evidence of faith which produces good deeds
	- e.g. Hebrews ~ there is similar dichotomy built-up between faith & salvation also
	- There are not [finally] resolvable; you may occassionally resolve such a concept in a finite context but not in general.

21) "able to save" then why doesn't it?  Because you don't study it, read it, or partake at all.


25) perseveres/continues in it (the Word) ~ _eleutheria parameno_ i.e. abides in the law of liberty
