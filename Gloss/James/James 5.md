# James 5


13-18) No prayer means no relationship ~ with God or others.

16)
The effectiveness of a prayer is based on our proximity to God.
When we live in license, atop God's grace, we remove ourselves from the kingdom workflow.
...rejection of His deliverance (by continued sin) is training the mind to disbelieve since we were not, in the end, saved
