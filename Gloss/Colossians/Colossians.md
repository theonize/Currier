# Colossians

If there is any group of people who should be immune to prejudgment of others based on colors and creeds it is the Church.
But we, often, are not; the root of which is the heresy of the subversion of Christ.


Probably written during Paul's Roman imprisonment, circa 60

Paul probably never went to Colossae; so, his expression to them is through secondhand knowledge and assumption based on the working of the Spirit and people from there.

ancient Colossae:

Location: Colossae was situated in the Lycus River Valley in southwestern Anatolia, near the modern town of Honaz in Turkey. It was part of the region known as Phrygia during antiquity.

History: The city's history dates back to at least the 6th century BCE. It was founded by the Phrygians and later came under the control of the Persian Empire. In the Hellenistic period, it was influenced by Greek culture and became an important city in the region.

Commerce: Colossae was strategically located along trade routes that connected the Aegean Sea with the interior of Anatolia. It was known for its production of a distinctive red woolen cloth called "Colossian wool," which was highly regarded in the ancient world.

Religion: The city was home to a diverse population with various religious beliefs. It is mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible as one of the recipients of the Letter to the Colossians, which is attributed to the Apostle Paul.

Earthquake: Colossae was struck by a devastating earthquake in the 1st century CE, which contributed to its decline. Nearby cities like Laodicea and Hierapolis became more prominent in the region.

Archaeological Remains: Today, there are limited archaeological remains of ancient Colossae. The city is largely in ruins, and many of its structures have not been well-preserved. The site has not been extensively excavated like some other ancient cities.
