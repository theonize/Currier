From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
to the saints, the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ, at Colossae.
Grace and peace to you from God our Father!


We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
since we heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints.
Your faith and love have arisen from the hope laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard about in the message of truth, the gospel that has come to you. 
Just as in the entire world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, so it has also been bearing fruit and growing among you from the first day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth.
You learned the gospel from Epaphras, our dear fellow slave - a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf - who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
For this reason we also, from the day we heard about you, have not ceased praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
so that you may live worthily of the Lord and please him in all respects - bearing fruit in every good deed, growing in the knowledge of God,
being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for the display of all patience and steadfastness, 
joyfully giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the saints' inheritance in the light.
