# 2 Kings 5

God's plan is grand but your solution is simple

Namaan's decent into faith:
* Shock: Faced with disease at his pinnacle
* Listened: received a testimony from his wife's slave
* Yearning for deliverance
* Shock: Expecting a grand miracle he gets a text
* Listened: received officers' good counsel and had his need met
* Yearning for proximity

Namaan was the highly successful commander of the Assyrian armies.
Israel had been conquered by Assyria and was a vassal state- a subject of the Assryian emperor.
However, Namaan had leprosy (a skin disease.)

During their exploits Namaan had acquired a young Jewish girl as a slave.
This girl told him, "**If only you could go and see Elisha, he would heal you**."

So Namaan went and told this to the king, who said, "Go! and I'll send a letter to the king of Israel to let them know you're coming."
As you might imagine, the Israelite king was distressed- the commander of the powerful empire subjagating them was coming for a visit.
The king tore his robes as a sign of his distress.

When Elisha heard about this he told the king, "Don't get so upset. **Send him to me and he will know there is a prophet in Israel**."

When Namaan arrived at Elisha's house, Elisha didn't even come out to meet him.
Elisha sent out a messenger to tell Namaan to go wash in the Jordan River seven times and he would be healed.

Namaan was furious, "I was telling myself the prophet would come out and say a spell and wave his hand and cure me.
Instead I have to bathe in a dirty river- we have bigger, cleaner river back home!"

But his servants approached him and said, "If the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it.
Why not do this simple thing?"

So, Namaan went and dipped seven times in the Jordan River and **his skin was restored and he was clean**.

Then Namaan went back to Elisha and said, "now I know there's no God in the whole world but in Israel."
Namaan wanted to pay but Elisha refused.
So Namaan said, "if not, then at least let me take two loads of dirt back with me..."

As the emperor's right-hand man he would accompany to aging emperor into the temple of the god Rimmon and assist with the ceremonies to worship that deity.
**Namaan wanted the dirt so he could stand on holy ground and have Yahweh's favor when surrounded by worship of false gods**.

What did Elisha say?
* "Take these scrolls and make sure you read from them every day."
* "Here's a calendar, we have seven feasts and you have to celebrate every one."
* "Come back every spring because you have to sacrifice in this temple."
* "Here's a set of clothes and a bar of soap- you have present yourself a certain way."
* ...

No, Elisha said, "**Shalom**." [go in peace]

How often have we bought into the utter lie that, once believing, we must do something to continue in faith?
Or, worse, that we must continually refresh our faith through religious practice?
Worse still, that there is something we have yet to pay...that we owe God a little more to keep His favor?

These ideas are not silly, they are dangerous.
They undervalue the work the God has done and the deeper adoration that He has for us.
There is no transaction with God- He gives salvation and that is the end of it.

As living stones in the temple of God, The Church, we have the sacred ground with us wherever we go, just as Namaan did.
As a purchased people, now set free, we have often yearn to _make up_ for we received but we cannot.
Go in peace.
