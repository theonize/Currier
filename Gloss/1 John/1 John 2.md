# 1 John 2


27) All believers have a capacity for discernment which is a gift of the Spirit.
Additionally, God can redeem our time and effort in seeking Him by multiplying these efforts.
This is not necessarily a proclamation of divine knowledge and certainly not a validation of any one of our interpretations or prophecies.
However, there is proof of divine intervention through the mind- as noted: often through an addendum of existing works.
He notes that such divine teaching is true and not a lie: the only way we can differentiate these is through the counsel of all the Scriptures.
