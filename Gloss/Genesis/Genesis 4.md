Genesis 4


# Cain and Abel

History
God has promised a redeemer and here is a brand-new man from Eve's womb.
There was obviously a system of worship in place, and Cain and Abel were both aware of it.
There were other humans outside of Adam's realm, because Cain mentions them and is afraid of them.
This instantiates the idea of the "marked": those who are exiled from the exiles.
God's people are separate from the rest, but some are separated again.

Culture
This becomes a story about devotion to the Lord.
It is also an analysis of the shallowness of sinful thought: Cain does not retaliate against God but against Abel.
More, famous rhetorical questions from God.
We have the pattern established of the wanderer.

Literary style
Short narrative then expository dialogue.

Theology



The murderous rivalry between siblings increases from here on
- Cain & Abel
- Moses & Ramses
- Moses & Aaron
- Jacob's sons


2) Jobs
   - Abel was a shepherd
   - Cain was a farmer
   - The role of each is part of their identity, but the consequences are not related to their vocation/role
   - shepherds were always considered a lower class
   - farmers were a higher-class, more refined
     - one of the lynchpins of empire is the advent of farming technique modernization

3-4) Cain brought an offering, Abel brought a sacrifice
  - [Matt ?:?]() The widow brought 2 mites and was exalted by Jesus for giving a sacrificial offering


6-8) God dialogues with Cain but not with Abel
     - Abel's heart is right and there is no need for the __sanctifying talk__
     - Cain is in need of redemption and God attempts to bring him back to the fold

7) This event likely occurs at a "high place", there is a door to Eden which is blocked by angels
   - the door is valid as a metaphor but is also, literally, at the door of the garden of Eden; i.e. the mountain of God



## Cain's Lineage; vv.15+

- HISTORY: Antediluvian, post-Eden people who chose not to be in God's preisthood
- CULTURE: This story sets up the pattern of the dispossessed son who lives at odds with God
- LITERATURE: We have a genealogical narrative establishing two lines
- MEANING:
  - sevenfold, seventy-fold are ways of saying "throw the book at" or __all of the law__
  - names have meaning and tell part of the story
- THEOLOGY:
  - there are two choices are play here: God's choice to redeem and man's choice to accept or reject


15) We don't know what the mark of Cain is but it was surely something that all people [of the day] would recognize.  
    It could have been a known symbol: God seems to still interact with people even though they are exiled from the garden.
    It could have been a demeanor: the redeemed person carries themselves in a particular way.
  Sevenfold is a way of saying "throw the book at him"; i.e. the full extent of the law.

16) Cain left the presence of God to the land of wanderers in the east
    East is always a place of foreboding and exile.
    Nod means wanderers; perhaps a geography, perhaps a sub-culture.

17) Cain has a son, Enoch (not the Enoch who later walks with God)
    Where did Cain's wife come from?
    - his sister?
    - other people already outside of Eden?
  The city is a construct meant for defense in case of war.
  - Cain is afraid, and is no longer in God's presence, so he builds a construct meant to protect him from the world.
  - Enoch means dedicated; the city is like a memorial- quite a congnitive conundrum; the self-consequenced exile constructing a memorial wall against humanity. 
  - quite the anithesis of redeemed/saved who stay at the face of God

18) Cain's lineage:
    - Enoch; dedicated
    - Irad; fleet, wild-ass
    - Mehujael; smitten, proclaimer
    - Methushael; of-God, demands-death
    - Lamech; powerful, made-low


19,23) Lamech goes for more: 2 wives and an order-of-magnitude more punishment for his murder

19) Adah; ornament
    Zillah; shade

20-22) Lamech+Adah -> 
    - Jabal; stream-of-water
      - he is the original shepherd
    - Jubal; stream
      - the original musician
    Lamech+Zillah ->
    - Tubal-Cain; brought-of-Cain, worldy-possession
      - the original smithy
    - Naamah; loveliness

    There is at least an intellectual link here with the descendant watchers
    - the fallen ones taught women how to seduce men with makeup and ornaments
    - they also taught men how to make weapons of war
    - curiously, there is no-one linking the __pharmakeia__ aspect of the watcher's teaching AND shepherding/muscisianship are inherently godly

23-24) Lamech kills a boy, and a man
       - he claims his own mark of protection
       - surely this is a misappropriation of God's judgment upon Cain and a mis-understanding of God's working

25) Adam+Eve -> Seth; puts-right
    - the replacement

26) Seth -> Enosh
    - man; mortal
  QRA ~ men __called__ upon the name of Yahweh
  - this could be preaching the good news, hopefulness
  - e.g. Abraham QRA Yahweh as a form of ministry to his tribe [Gen 13:4]()
