Polemic of Mesopotamian myths
+ divine judgement
+ chosen man
+ sacred dimensions of the vessel
+ boat runs aground on mountain
+ birds sent out
+ sacrifice to god(s)
+ humanity renewed
- some have a rebel god warning man in secret
- flood ends because his get hungry
- others have multiple divine beings involved in the decision making


1-4) A pointed polemic to overturn the myth of Babylonian/human superiority.
A further corruption of creation; intended to defile the seed of Yahweh.
1st Mention: Sons of God
Interesting parallels with many mythologies.
A continuation of the pattern of corruption.
The intention of the divine rebels was to displace [breed out] humanity.
- the communion/merging of the divine and human is rebellious (e.g. sorcery, witchcraft)

2) The attraction/lust is as much, or more, the desire to corrupt the human line and take power.  [Ez 28:13+]()

3) God's Spirit won't abide-in/strive-with man: God+man is a struggle on this Earth
The breath/life is not inherited, is it given to each (Golem).
120 years...until the flood.
,,,also 3x40; 40===time-of-trial, 3 stages/phases of life

4) The "sons of god" had to have physical, human form.
[Gen 19]() ~ another account of the sexuality of divine beings
The blending of divine+human was done when God created Adam from dust+breath; this way is inferior.
Men of renown ~ Gibborim, [Deut 3:10-11](), [1Sam 1:27]()

5-6) hearts: mens' full of evil, God's full of love

5, 12) Sight ~ during creation Yahweh _saw_ good; now He _sees_ corruption

6) regret/repent ~ divine judgment came from a place of grief & pain


8) Noah found favor ~ something we desparately want

9) 3 things that make Noah special: godly, blameless, walked with God.
- sadiq ~ righteous; i.e. right-wise - knowing what is right AND doing it
- tamim ~ perfect; complete without blemish; later used to describe acceptable sacrifices
- halak h'elohim ~ went with God; i.e. side-by-side living
Noah "walked" with God ~ went with, used also to describe the way water flows


13) An end of all flesh came before God ~ He is revealing the irreversible corruption of the Earth.
He, therefore, accelerates the end of the current state.
This is the mercy of divine judgment- that He will not allow the ruination to linger.
Surely part of the decreation must be to eliminate certain aspects that prevent a similar ruination afterwards: the imprisonment of the divine beings that directly influenced people.


14-21) A further countering of _tohu v'bohu_ (formless and chaotic) from [Gen 1]()
- making the ark ~ forming the earth
- filling it with life - making creatures
