# Genesis 8


## Ararat
~ the curse of trembling
The Ark was lifted to the mountaintop, from the man descends to re-populate the earth.


## Wind 
~ RVK
- the parting of the Red Sea hearkens back to this


## Remember
~ XCR
- God does not forget, He recalls the to the present
- Remembering is bringing things to the present in the context of human existence
- Or, recalling to the forefront a thing whose time has come
- We remember when prompted by an association; God remembers when He brings forward
  - a modern analogy: a computer does not forget data, it is stored and is recalled when the program is loaded; God's events are like a timed event which runs the program which recalls the data
- Memory and remembrance is only significant in the human paradigm; i.e. within time.  It is not a valid concept in the divine realm.

  Remember that Noah brought extras "clean" animals for sacrifice.
He prepared for God's deliverance.
