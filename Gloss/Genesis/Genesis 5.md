# Genesis 5
# The First Genealogy

Genealogies can be difficult because we the typical christian doesn't understand why there are genealogies in the Bible and doesn't understand the makeup of a genealogy.
Modern historical records tend to be timestamped logs of events, or close to it.
Ancient historical records tend to be narrative accounts of purposeful events- their genealogies are no different.

## History
This chapter describes the line of Seth, who was the successor to the slain Abel.
All those mentioned in this lineage died at or before the flood, except for Noah.

## Culture
The line of Seth is not magically endowed with righteousness, but they are the line of the promised seed.
Contrast this with the line of Cain, who are the line of the serpent.
Cain's line tends toward rebellion and struggle; Seth's line tends toward righteousness and peace.

	Ken Follett (Genesis 1-11) goes into detail about these numbers- drawing parallels with other ancient "conquering king" texts.
	Suffice to say, while the fundamentalist takes these numbers literally it is not necessary to do so in order to maintain a high view of infallible scripture.
	Either position is relevant but the long-lifespan view creates issues later on mainly because it imbues a strict-completeness view of genealogies; that is, the idea that genealogies are complete and do not skip generations.
	Modern humans (genetically speaking) are not capable of breeding the numbers of people necessary to build the societies of Genesis 4-6 (or Genesis 11, or Exodus 1-2 for that matter) from the numbers of people given in the timespan of the number of generations given.
	Sparse genealogies are not an apologetic problem for us, though, because there are examples of genealogies with gaps: notably Ezra's genealogy in Ezra 7:1-5 & 1 Chronicles 6:3-15 (see the Genealogy study for more).

	Noah's lifespan after having sons is not given: his end is not commensurate with the current theological point, that the tale of lines is culminating.
	Also interesting that Noah was much older when he had sons: this could imply that the world was changing, that he was simply different in attitude or circumstance, or maybe he had to start over at some point.
	- all of this is speculative but it is a marked difference with his predecessors
	
	Also interesting that Methusaleh dies the year of the flood.
	- some traditions hold that Methusaleh's death "allowed" the flood to come because he was last of the line of Seth;  however, there is not indication here that he was righteous of worthy of such capacity.
	- it is somewhat likely that he just died in the flood with everyone else.
	- this issue brings up an important point: the lineage does not determine the righteousness [or destiny] of the folk.
