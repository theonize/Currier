# Genesis 3

## Genesis 3:1-19

* History
  * the origin story of all people of God
  * written to the diasporic from Egypt
  * the story is fraught with broken cultural paradigms of the place of the man/woman
* Theology
  * Sin brings consequences.
  * Separation from God is bad.
  * Man is separated from the tree of life, otherwise he would eat of it and live forever in a fallen state.
  * Eve is not cursed- the seed of the woman is the only hope humans have.
* Literature
  * narrative w/ dialog, the story 
  * legal, the judgment given by God
* Words
  * serpent = NK$, the shining one; only serpentine in the broader theological sense like dragon and leviathan- the chaos gods
  * GN LRCH Y'M ~ garden's spirit/wind of-the-day;  at the wind of the day = there was already a prescribed meeting time with God


1. Why wasn't Eve startled or unsettled by the nachash?
  ...probably because it was not unknown to her, maybe because she had confidence in some measure of Godly protection
  ...NK$ is a title, much like S+N and diabolos
  YRVM ~ shrewdness, craftiness; not an inherently negative trait
  We are called the be shrewd by Jesus: [Matthew 10:16]()
  The serpent twists the command:
    "any"~ NK$ is twisting the command of God

2. Adam had added to God's command when he gave it Eve: "or touch it"; 
  ...thus making it more difficult and more likely to be challenged

3. God did not actually prohibit touching the tree; Adam & Eve added this prohibition.
  This kind of extrapolation was to become a typical Jewish perogative.
  ...we should avoid adding our own interpretive conclusions to Scripture.
  ...this doubtful dismissal of God's word is the preeminent human failure

4. An outright lie- it is his nature to contradict God
  NK$ plants a seed of doubt, the human acts on it- in ways far grander than the initial temptation.
  The serpents advantage is that he knows the resultant death is not immediate.
  So, Adam watches Eve eat and not die immediately and then partakes.


6. She perceived some benefits of the fruit, but they didn't have the foresight to see the actual outcome
"her husband, who was with her"- Adam observed the interaction with NK$ and was silent!
Eve was deceived, Adam was guilty.
  - this is why the immaculate conception of Jesus is important: He does not inherit Adamic guilt, he is of the seed of the woman alone

7. "eyes...were opened" is a euphemism; might it also be literal?
  i.e. a physiological change which removed some protection from them
  some traditions speak of Adam&Eve being "clothed in light" which may allude to a condition of graceful protection they were in
  Nakedness then becomes unacceptable to them...contrast to [Gen 2:25]()

8. Yahweh Elohim, name explicitly
  "at the time of the evening breeze"

9. God called Adam ~ any doubt who was responsible?


11. "Who told you that you were naked?"
  They were naked before; it is just now that they are ashamed of it.

12. Adam let Eve take the lead with NK$; now he passes blame to her

13. Eve blames the deceiver but she and Adam were the ones who actually performed the sinful act.

14, 17. Two cursed things: the serpent and the land

15. Protovangelion ~ first good news
Man attacks first, then the NK$
attack/bruise ~ shuwph ~ an expansive, crushing blow
  - Job 9:17
  - PS 139:11


16-19. The commandment is God, to be fruitful and multiply, is now made exceedingly difficult as a consequence of The Fall.


16. the pain is not just physical but the emotional distress of worry and uncertainty

The woman wants to control the man.  The man wants to dominate the woman.
The ideal is implied by contrast: a complementary submission based on God-given roles.


19. Adam was taken "from dust"; doubly: made from carbon-based substance and from the ground, the barren, chaotic earth, into the garden.


## Genesis 3:20-24
* History
  * Written to diasporic Hebrew nomads in the Sinai desert
  * Written by a Hebrew orphan raised as Egyptian nobility
  * This is codification of an oral, traditional story
* Literature
  * This section is a narration of God's program immediately after doling out consequences from The Fall
* Lexicography
  * KVH ~ Eve; is first named here: `life` is in her and hope for redemption.
  * YVR ~ skin/hide; 
  * TVB, RY ~ good, evil; counterplay of cosmic programs
  * ADMH ~ Adamah; ground, from when ADM came, he works it, then he decays back into it
  * V'BR$ ~ drove-out; literally forcing out, sometimes in the context of divorce: rejecting a woman and sending her away.
* Theology
  * This passage lays the groundwork for future reconciliation with God.
  * The Fall has massive consequences that will take millenia to resolve but Adam & Eve couldn't know that.
  * We also see the divine council in play here.
  * The flaming, whirling sword is an icon of God's conquering justice.


20. Adam's responded to his wife by naming her (and later reproduced with her)
    * Adam renames his wife _after_ the curse signifying that he associates redemption with her childbearing.


21. Yahweh gets skins from somewhere, obviously animals had to die.
    * We know that, later, humans had a program of sacrifice so it seems likely that God initiated it...perhaps here.
    * This is the patterning of ritual sacrifice: one thing dies to _cover_ another.


22. 'us' = divine council
    * To be divine is to know things beyond the natural; i.e. good & evil.
'put forth his hand'

    * Now that humans had broken **the** rule it was likely they would break more.
      ...So, God separates them from eternal, physical life.
    * If they had been allowed to attain eternal, physical life they would have lived forever in the fallen state.


23. God drives humans out of paradise to work the ground; they must know cause the ground to yield fruit- it no longer does so naturally.


24. Yahhweh **drove** them out ~ ekbalo
    * [Mark 1:] the Spirit drove Jesus (after the baptism)
    * The entrance to Eden is in the East-
      * East always symbolizes foreboding, it is also the vast unknown landscape: to the ANE inhabitant it seemed that there was land to the east indefinitely...
    * Cherubims guard the entrance; these are the most powerful created beings, this is a serious level of guarding which is meant to prevent the greatest possible catastrophe: man living forever in his fallen state.
    * The flaming sword represents judgmental word of God
      * Fire is judgment and consumption; fire is unceremonious and unbigoted.
      * Later on the sword is God's word; He always fights His battles with this weapon because what He says comes to pass...He can operate the universe via voice command.
      * "keep the way of the tree of life"  God keeps [L$MR] the way, guards it, preserves it.  There will be a plan enacted to give humans eternal life again but it must be after their redemption from their sinful state.
