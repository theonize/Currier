# Genesis 3

1) why wasn't Eve startled or unsettled by the nachash?


3) God did not actually prohibit touching the tree.
This kind of extrapolation was to become a typical Jewish perogative.
...we should avoid adding our own interpretive conclusions to Scripture.
...this doubtful dismissal of God's word is the preeminent human failure


5) the elohim - plural, the divine council
	{Ps 8:5} {Heb 2:7}


9) God called Adam ~ any doubt who was responsible?


11) "Who told you that you were naked?"


14, 17) Two cursed things: the serpent and the land

15) Protovangelion ~ first good news
Man attacks first, then the Nachash
attack/bruise ~ shuwph ~ an expansive, crushing blow
  - Job 9:17
  - PS 139:11


16-19) The commandment is God, to be fruitful and multiply, is now made exceedingly difficult as a consequence of The Fall.


16) the pain is not just physical but the emotional distress of worry and uncertainty

The woman wants to control the man.  The man wants to dominate the woman.
The ideal is implied by contrast: a complementary submission based on God-given roles.


19) Adam was taken "from dust"; doubly: made from carbon-based substance and from the ground, the barren, chaotic earth, into the garden.

20) Adam's responded to his wife by naming her (and later reproduced with her)


22) 'us' = divine council
