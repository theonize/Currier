# Genesis 3


1) Why wasn't Eve startled or unsettled by the nachash?
  ...probably because it was not unknown to her, maybe because she had confidence in some measure of Godly protection
  ...NK$ is a title, much like S+N and diabolos
  YRVM ~ shrewdness, craftiness; not an inherently negative trait
  We are called the be shrewd by Jesus: [Matthew 10:16]()
  The serpent twists the command:
    "any"~ NK$ is twisting the command of God

2) Adam had added to God's command when he gave it Eve: "or touch it"; 
  ...thus making it more difficult and more likely to be challenged

3) God did not actually prohibit touching the tree; Adam & Eve added this prohibition.
  This kind of extrapolation was to become a typical Jewish perogative.
  ...we should avoid adding our own interpretive conclusions to Scripture.
  ...this doubtful dismissal of God's word is the preeminent human failure

4) An outright lie- it is his nature to contradict God
  NK$ plants a seed of doubt, the human acts on it- in ways far grander than the initial temptation


6) She perceived some benefits of the fruit, but they didn't have the foresight to see the actual outcome
"her husband, who was with her"- Adam observed the interaction with NK$ and was silent!
Eve was deceived, Adam was guilty.
  - this is why the immaculate conception of Jesus is important: He does not inherit Adamic guilt, he is of the seed of the woman alone

7) "eyes...were opened" is a euphemism; might it also be literal?
  i.e. a physiological change which removed some protection from them
  some traditions speak of Adam&Eve being "clothed in light" which may allude to a condition of graceful protection they were in
  Nakedness then becomes unacceptable to them...contrast to [Gen 2:25]()

8) Yahweh Elohim, name explicitly
  "at the time of the evening breeze"

9) God called Adam ~ any doubt who was responsible?


11) "Who told you that you were naked?"


14, 17) Two cursed things: the serpent and the land

15) Protovangelion ~ first good news
Man attacks first, then the Nachash
attack/bruise ~ shuwph ~ an expansive, crushing blow
  - Job 9:17
  - PS 139:11


16-19) The commandment is God, to be fruitful and multiply, is now made exceedingly difficult as a consequence of The Fall.


16) the pain is not just physical but the emotional distress of worry and uncertainty

The woman wants to control the man.  The man wants to dominate the woman.
The ideal is implied by contrast: a complementary submission based on God-given roles.


19) Adam was taken "from dust"; doubly: made from carbon-based substance and from the ground, the barren, chaotic earth, into the garden.

20) Adam's responded to his wife by naming her (and later reproduced with her)
  Adam renames his wife _after_ the curse signifying that he associates redemption with her childbearing.


22) 'us' = divine council


24,48) Yahhweh **drove** them out ~ ekbalo
	[Mark 1:] the Spirit drove Jesus (after the baptism)
