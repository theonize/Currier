# Genesis 11


City-building is akin to denial/rebellion of God

God _came down_ to see the tower; a pun reporting how far beneath him it was.

Babel means "confusion" in Hebrew; it means "gates of the gods" in Akkadian
the dispersion of the nations is a flood of peoples
...seas is often a reference to the peoples/nations


1-8) Tower of Babel
The point of this tower (probably a ziggurat) is to localize the deity.
Yahweh will not be tamed in this manner.
He will, ultimately, make His own sacred space(s) in which to dwell.
Subsequent to this Yahweh calls Abraham to begin creating His own people.
