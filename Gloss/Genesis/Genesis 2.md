# Genesis 2


Whereas chapter 1 is poetic, this chapter is narration.


God does not _make_ man.
He forms man from the dust; i.e. vicariously, through a natural process.
He works on us and among us physically.


## Humanity

Here, God establishes humanity and the place in which he will meet with them.
Man was put into the garden (meaning they were outside.)
Man was given work.
He also establishes rules of engagement with them- not to constrain them but to dissuade them from behaviors whose consequence is separation from Him.
His removal of the tree of life prevents them from eternal separation after they received good&evil.



## Terracing

God establishes Eden as the fountainhead of blessing to the world.
He rests in the garden, within Eden, which is upon the earth.
This 3-tiered arrangement is seen again in tabernacle and temple architecture.

Pishon ~ changing; from the mouth
  Havilah ~ suffers; brings forth
  ...good gold; there are isotopes of gold that are unstable
  ...bdellium & onyx may be found in rough terrain, above ground
Gihon ~ valley of grace
  Cush ~ black; later Ethiopia
Tigris ~ swift river; trade-worthy?
Euphrates ~ makes fruiful


1-3) Shabbat; God establishes the pattern of 6x work && 1x rest
...this repetition continues throughout scripture and beyond

4) The first mention of Yahweh

5) the elohim - plural, the divine council
	{Ps 8:5} {Heb 2:7}


8) Eden is "in the east"; later, Babylon is in the east and things "from the east" are frightful.
This area was co-opted by evil forces to oppose God's people.
e.g. during the Eygptian exile the Canaanites set up in the promised land, in the east, being prepared by watchers to oppose Israel.


15) work & keep
avad & shamar
these are priestly terms as well


17) Man did not die in an instant, upon eating the fruit, but the fruit made their death imminent.


18) amidst all the good of creation we now have the _not good_ of loneliness.
    It's also interesting that God considers Adam alone because he does not have a spouse.
    Yet, God made Adam wait for her...
    
    _ezer_ is oft translated "helper"- 
    This is not in the sense of an servant but a rescuer; re: [Ex 18:4]() [Ps 33:20]()
    Woman is a helper in the same sense that God ia.


19) God brings the beasts to Adam (likewise to Noah, later.)
The animals names stuck- the creator is hands-off in the usage of creation.

20) Every creature of sky and land was named by Adam- imagine the duration...
No animal is a fit helper for man- that is, none can be a perfect match.

21-22) Crucifixion parallel?  At His death Jesus side was opened by a Roman spear.
We receive life from the water & blood.

21) Adam is put to sleep; so is Abraham during his covenant exposure in Genesis 15.
The sleep is necessary for two reasons:
1. God does surgery on Adam.
2. God alone makes the helper- this emphasizes that she was not derived by man but from him.

rib ~ selah, it is a bone from the side, also used of structural member (a beam or plank.)

God made Eve and God brought Eve to Adam.


23) bone/flesh ~ Adam understood the sameness of Eve and her distinctiveness

As His bride how does the Church manifest 'bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh'?
