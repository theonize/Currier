Welcome back to Rediscovering the Bible.
On the heels of Genesis 4, which established the 2 spiritual lineages (that of the woman and the serpent), we move into the first genealogy of the Bible.
This is not the first account of offspring and heritage mentioned but it is the first long passage written in the style literary style of genealogy.
This means that it is a written progression of offspring and, in this case, some relative timespans.

It is natural for us to gloss over and skim these sections of scripture because we don't easily engage with them.
So, as some background, we need to go back to some basics: the Bible is not primarily a history document (nor a narrative) but a theological document.
Also, the Bible was not written via dictation from God but was the culmination of various human lives, in written form, which were guided by Providence.
This is what we mean when we say that scripture is a verbal plenary inspiration: it was God working through a human's life to produce scripture.
In light of this we can say that the genealogies, just like other passages, are purposeful and are included in scripture for our illumination.
More specifically, the names and timespans given have some theological significance.
Now, this is not to say that the there is no historical relevance or even scientific relevance (as far as genetic propogation or the progression of societies) but these are secondary considerations.
It is not necessary to make the Bible conform to modern historical or scientific thought in order to maintain a high view of scripture.
Our understanding of both history and science and fluid and flawed; even though, in places, we see dramatic explanatory and preditive power in scripture.

One important consideration in any genealogy is it's completeness.
Biblical genealogies, like other historical accounts in the Bible, are not exhaustive time-logs like modern historical accounts.
These are passages meant to exposit the work of God in the lineage of certain people groups.
An example of this is the genealogy of Ezra.
We find this in Ezra 7:1-5 and in 1 Chronicles 6:3-15.
Both have the same start and end point and share the same 8 generations at the start and end of the lineage; however, the Chronicles account has an additional 6 generations in the middle.
This should highlight to us that the purpose of the genealogy is not to give a precise historical accounting but, rather, to highlight God's providential shepherding of His nation.
This is not to say that these ancestry accounts are not important as historical record but that that is not the point of the passage.
Another example is the two genealogies of Jesus Christ in Matthew and Luke.
One is the father's lineage, the other is the mother's.
It is important to God to highlight the progression of the lineage along multiple paths- both necessary, both leading to an important culmination.

Another important thing to note is the inclusion of timespans in this genealogy.
The simplest interpretation is the take these as literal lifespans; from this many have gleaned an understanding that there was fundamental, biological difference in antediluvian humans and the nature of the world itself;
That is, the flood wrought major changes in humans and the in earth.
While this is explicable and not necessarily wrong, there are potential issues with taking these values literally:
First, increased human vitality and more favorable, natural conditions do not necessarily account for such a great increase in lifespan.
Second, not all ancient manuscripts agree on the numbers (for instance the Septuagint gives a much larger total.)
This should highlight that there is more going on here that just better humans and a better earth.
This numerological method of record is not unique to the Bible, it occurs in other ancient records as well (such as the Sumerian King List.)
Suffice to say, numbers in the Bible have important theological implications.
In this passage we should note that we are given the age at which each man fathered this particular son, then the number of years lived after, then the total.
Here, and after, the __first__ son has an important place.
It is not always the case that the first-born son is preeminent but there is always a "first" son in terms of heritage.
A full treatment of the numbers here is well beyond our abilities and time constraints but if you are interested a good starting point would be Bullinger's work "Number in Scripture".


The chapter begins with a reprise of the creation of heritage: humans are made in the likeness of God, blessed, and named.
This reminds us that human life is deliberate, not an incidental or accidental.
Even our part in the creation of life is done with willful intent.
Man is intialized, identified, blessed, and named; this pattern contiues through the chapter.
Each man in the genealogy is named, numbered as of when they first fathered a son, then further accounted as to the amount of time they fathered more __sons and daughters__, then totaled.
We are also reminded that each one died (except for one.)
This is repeated several times in the recounting of mortal man's line.
Recall that Eve supposed that she bore the promised son, the one who would bring reconciliation.
In fact, God's plan is much grander than this and involves many more people.
The line of Seth is not endowed with righteousness, but they are the line of the promised seed.
In fact, by the time of flood every one of these patriarchs was gone except for Noah (Methusaleh was the last, he died the year of the flood.)

Now, there are two notable exceptions in the passage:
First, Enoch is said to have walked with God and then God took him- he did not die as the others did.
His child-bearing years are described as "walking with God" rather than just "living".
Second, we have 3 of Noah's sons named whereas the others only have 1.
This is later important as we look at the significance of the number of people aboard the ark.
It is also important because Noah is signified as being _righteous_, thus his lineage is worth more scrutiny.

The usage of names in the genealogy is also important.
Names of Biblical characters are not arbitrary but are descriptive of the life of that person.
We see this throughout scripture; Peter and Paul are explicit examples of men who were renamed to signify their new life in Christ.
An example of this in the Old Testament in the character of Jacob who is renamed Israel; in fact, in his story he is called by either name depending on the quality of this behavior at the time.

In this account we have 10 names given, 10 is often indicative of perfection or completion.
In this case it signifies the completion of the providental lineage of the seed of the woman leading up to the deluge.
We can glean the meaning of the names using Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary or a tool like stepbible.com or blueletterbible.org:

	Adam ~		man
	Seth ~		fixed [stuck]
	Enosh ~		mortal [man]
	Kenan ~		possessed [as in owned]
	Mahalalel ~	blessed/praising God
	Jared ~		descends
	Enoch ~		dedicated
	Methusaleh ~ sent his death
	Lamech ~	made low / powerful
				_for_
	Noah ~		consolation

If you read those names in succession you get a rough outline of God's redemptive plan: man was fixed, mortal, possessed, but the blessed God descended and dedicated, sent to his death for consolation.
Now, you would hard-pressed to believe that Moses or some 3rd century BC Jewish scholars encoded the christian gospel in the names of the first 10 patriarchs.
Rather, it showcases that God's plan of redemption was set from the beginning and was established in the very flow of history.
Based on this account we see that God prefers us to understand that succession in terms of people who are part of His plan.

Adam took part in the plan by establishing the practice of naming his _first_ (first, as in firstfruit or priority) and fathering many more children.
This takes place on the heels of the debacle with Cain that established the line of the serpent.

Enoch did not just live but walked with God; as Charles Spurgeon said (I'm paraphrasing) "he desired the company of God...and walked into paradise".

Lamech (not the antagonist of the chapter 4, different man) was not declared as righteous but understood his part in the plan and recognized the destiny of his son, Noah.

And Noah's part in the story is what we will cover in many subsequent episodes.

If we take anything away from this chapter we should recognize that humans and the flow of human civilization through time is important to God.
His scripture records this lineage which leads in a particular, purposeful direction.
It also records that individual humans are important to Him as well.
It is as if all of history has been orchestrated so that each one of us can have the utmost chance to come to know God- and each of us can claim that.
That is the grand mystery of history.

God's chosen path is one of human increase and fulfillment.
The worldly path is human reduction and subjugation.
This provides us with a wonderful lens with which to view issues we face as individuals and as a society: if the path leads to division, fewer people, or less fulfillment for any then it is not a Godly path.
