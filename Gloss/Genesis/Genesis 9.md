# Genesis 9

"Be fruitful and multiply" ~ continuing the Adamic typology


20-27) There are idioms and verbage here which indicates some sexual act.
Canaan is cursed, not Ham.
"See the nakedness" is only powerful as an idiom (it's mostly unavoidable in normal family life):
	[Lev 20:17] ~ this exposits the idiom - it implies sexual intercourse
	[Ez 16:35-37]
	[Ez 23:10+]

	[Lev 18:6-18] ~ the key here is v.7,10,14 which exposits that the "nakedness" of the man is his wife;

	this means that Ham attempted to usurp Noah's position via incest with his mother
	...the offspring of the incest, Canaan, was thus cursed

	Shem and Japheth, by walking backwards and covering mom, do a good thing and refuse to go the route of Ham.
