# Genesis 9

1) "Be fruitful and multiply" ~ continuing the Adamic typology
2) Fear of man
   - same creature order as Genesis 1
   - reiteration man's dominion
   - the 2nd mention of fear, the first is when fallen man encounters God for the 1st time
3) animals are now provisioned for food
   - in addition to plants
   - [Genesis 1:29]()
4) the prohibition against blood is a remembrance of God's sovereignty in giving the life, the provision of meat
   - the life belongs to God
   - it is also a healthful thing, to avoid pathogens
   - Moses is writing this setup the laws which come later
5-6) blood is required to atone for murder, including that done by animals
     - because men are imagers of God
     - the murderous rivalry between siblings increases from here on

  This enmity between man, God, and nature is reversed in the new Eden, via the messiah: [Isaiah 11]()

7) Another reiteration of the procreation mandate: this is obviously important
8-16) God establishes a covenant
   - with Noah, his sons, and their offspring; i.e. all people
   - AND with every living creature from the Ark
- The substance of the covenant
  - never again destruction via water
- The sign of the covenant: the rainbow

17) Noah confirms/recognizes the covenant and its sign
18) Foreshadowing that Canaan is a pivotal character

20-27) There are idioms and verbage here which indicates some sexual act.
Noah's laying uncovered may imply a sexual act [with his wife]
Canaan is cursed, not Ham.
- because Canaan was an illegitimate offspring
It is a recurring theme that a som sleeps with his father's wife as a means to overrun him.
"See the nakedness" is only powerful as an idiom (it's mostly unavoidable in normal family life):
	[Lev 20:17] ~ this exposits the idiom - it implies sexual intercourse
	[Ez 16:35-37]
	[Ez 23:10+]

	[Lev 18:6-18] ~ the key here is v.7,10,14 which exposits that the "nakedness" of the man is his wife;

	this means that Ham attempted to usurp Noah's position via incest with his mother
	...the offspring of the incest, Canaan, was thus cursed

	Shem and Japheth, by walking backwards and covering mom, do a good thing and refuse to go the route of Ham.
