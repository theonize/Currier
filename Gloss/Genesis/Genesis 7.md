# Genesis 7


The animals came in pairs, as they did to Adam.
Noah is typical of Adam and the Ark is a micro-Eden.

Was the flood global?
  There are many flood myths around the world.
  There is also evidence around the globe of a cataclysm like this.
  # Younger-Dryess event
  # Every ancient culture has a major flood myth which are roughly coincident with the Biblical account 
  The biblical authors were but aware of the the globe not all it's continents.

  ...it does not make a difference theologically.  What matters is the reboot and redemption brought via ablution.


Clean/Unclean
- Noah had this notion at least as far as acceptability of sacrifice, perhaps also as nutrition and usefulness


## What is a flood?
- mb'l ~ deluge, celestial sea, flowing waters
- in those case it is a mixing of the 3 tiers of creation: deeps, land, and heaven
~ In Psalm 29 God is enthroned on the mb'l, the celestial sea
...Yahweh is the King of Mabul; the King of what they feared the most- the chaotic waters.
  - they feared to sail out of sight of the shore
  - they were dependent upon rain and springs for crops/food
- [Gen 30:20]() ~ God opened Rachel's womb and children came forth from the waters of birth


## The divided waters

The great-deep and the sky; the waters were divided thus during creation.
Ancient people did not know about the water cycle.
Their knew that there were "springs"- waters in the ground- and waters above; i.e. clouds brought rain from above.
They believed that God held the waters in their place; this is literally, indirectly true: the laws of nature hold these things in place.
So, though we do not live in a dome, scripture can still be applied in the context of our understanding because it does not precisely contradict the nature of creation.

It was when God released His hand (He withdrew the restraints on the waters) that the water crashed forth.
...the deep and the heavens came together- a cosmic collpase of heaven and earth; i.e. decreation.


## De-Creation / Re-Creation

All land-flesh were destroyed.
The land itself and the fish were not destroyed.
The initiation of the de-creation was a baptism that didn't wash away but, rather, destroyed.
The remnant was alone, floating amidst the chaotic waters.
When the flood was over the remnant had to wait even longer for the waters' recession.
The recreation was the drying of the land and the seeding of new life.

- the waters were GBR "mighty"
  - the Nephilim were also GBR but the waters prevailed over them
  - the water prevailed over the mountains ~ mountains were the abode of gods


## Fifteen

The waters were 15 cubits deep, the Ark was 30 cubits high
15 is indicative of redemptive rest
- Hezekiah was granted an extra 15 years
- Passover is Nisan 15th
- 15 x 10 days of waters prevailing over the earth: perfect de-creation, redemption, then rest
