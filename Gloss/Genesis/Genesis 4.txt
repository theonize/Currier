Genesis 4


# Cain and Abel

History
God has promised a redeemer and here is a brand-new man from Eve's womb.
There was obviously a system of worship in place, and Cain and Abel were both aware of it.
There were other humans outside of Adam's realm, because Cain mentions them and is afraid of them.
This instantiates the idea of the "marked": those who are exiled from the exiles.
God's people are separate from the rest, but some are separated again.

Culture
This becomes a story about devotion to the Lord.
It is also an analysis of the shallowness of sinful thought: Cain does not retaliate against God but against Abel.
More, famous rhetorical questions from God.
We have the pattern established of the wanderer.

Literary style
Short narrative then expository dialogue.
