Genesis 4


# Cain and Abel

History
God has promised a redeemer and here is a brand-new man from Eve's womb.
There was obviously a system of worship in place, and Cain and Abel were both aware of it.
There were other humans outside of Adam's realm, because Cain mentions them and is afraid of them.
This instantiates the idea of the "marked": those who are exiled from the exiles.
God's people are separate from the rest, but some are separated again.

Culture
This becomes a story about devotion to the Lord.
It is also an analysis of the shallowness of sinful thought: Cain does not retaliate against God but against Abel.
More, famous rhetorical questions from God.
We have the pattern established of the wanderer.

Literary style
Short narrative then expository dialogue.

Theology



The murderous rivalry between siblings increases from here on
- Cain & Abel
- Moses & Ramses
- Moses & Aaron
- Jacob's sons


2) Jobs
   - Abel was a shepherd
   - Cain was a farmer
   - The role of each is part of their identity, but the consequences are not related to their vocation/role
   - shepherds were always considered a lower class
   - farmers were a higher-class, more refined
     - one of the lynchpins of empire is the advent of farming technique modernization

3-4) Cain brought an offering, Abel brought a sacrifice
  - [Matt ?:?]() The widow brought 2 mites and was exalted by Jesus for giving a sacrificial offering


6-8) God dialogues with Cain but not with Abel
     - Abel's heart is right and there is no need for the __sanctifying talk__
     - Cain is in need of redemption and God attempts to bring him back to the fold

7) This event likely occurs at a "high place", there is a door to Eden which is blocked by angels
   - the door is valid as a metaphor but is also, literally, at the door of the garden of Eden; i.e. the mountain of God
