# Genesis 47


31) Jacob leaned on his bed/staff and worshipped
  This is the first use of the word worship:
    it isn't thru song or sermon but through an introspective recount of Providence's work in his life
    the traditional interpretation is "staff" from MTH, this is promoted by the Hebrews 11:21 recounting, it literally means "bed" but is a pun which can be taken either way, the theological fundament is the same.
