# Exodus 12

2) Repurposing the calendar


5) I wonder if there is correlation between Jesus' death-age and the lamb being a yearling?
May be a sheep or goat...


6) Suggesting that (w/ v.2) they had 2 weeks to prepare


11) Passover means exactly that _passed-over_; it carries the idea of an exemption


13b; 29a) Yahweh himself struck down "all the firstborn of Egypt"


23) Moses adds them but about God passing over meaning: not allowing the destroyer to enter; in v.29 God takes personal responsibility for killing the firstborn
[Ps 78:49]()
[Ez 10]()


29) the LORD does the killing


36) Interesting flavor of "favor" ~ this was not lovingkindness but a grace of gifts (out of fear, maybe out of hope for a _blessing of adjacency_ i.e. v.33 "we shall all be dead")

  "They let them have what[ever]" ~ Israel must have taken everything they could carry.  The Egyptians were so cowed that they did not refuse any take.


40-41) 430yrs in captivity, and now 476yrs until Solomon's reign [1Kgs 6:1]()
  ...this is probably an estimate or numerology; 
  - Stephen estimates further in [Acts 7:6]() @ 400yrs ~ this is given as the time of enslavement, implying that it was 30yrs before the Israelites were enslaved


43-49) Gentile inclusion


51) "All the people of Israel did..." probably the last time this was true.
