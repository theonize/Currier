# Exodus 20


2-6) The first two _commandments_ are not behaviors to be avoided but to be done.


8-11) One day per week should be set apart for rest.  


12) This is lifelong: even after the parents perish the child honors them through remembrance and respect for their legacy (i.e. siblings and investments.)


15) God does supports private property
covetousness is idolatry
