# 2 Peter 2


Peter is preparing them for the passing of the 1st generation of disciples.
Part of this preparation was the writing of the gospels and many letters to expound biblical doctrine.
- Adam & Eve didn't have the written word which contributed to their susceptibility to deception; 
  ...the Serpent changed "touch" to "eat" and this made a loophole through which they were imbued with doubt [when they touched the fruit].


4-9) Peter correlates the ungodliness of The Fall, the Nephilim, the Sodomites- the desire to overcome Yahweh. 


10) _indulged their flesh in depraved lust_ is language that describes watchers
