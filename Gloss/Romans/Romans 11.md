# Romans 11


25) 


26) What is "all Israel"
- ethnic Jews?
- subset of Israel?  all Jews are Israelites but not all Israelites are Jews
- [Gal 3]

Jews
- the term "Jew" was created by the captor to describe the captives
    - [Jer 34:9] ~ 
    - [Dan] 
    - [Zech 8:23] ~ 
- Israelite was the preferred self-address
- 'udios' and Jew are not synonomous

We associate "Jew" based on an ethnic group associated with the Tanakh and Biblical festival-keeping.
The Biblical authors spoke of 'udios' as an ethnic construct but w/o the religious aspect.
They also used Israel as a sociological construct based on theology: Yahweh as LORD.
