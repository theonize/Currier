# Romans 1


1-7) Paul states his position and role as he sees it, then couches the authority of that position in terms dedicated the hearers of this letter.
	He is writing to believers in Rome but more specifically, as is his norm, beginning with Jews therein.
	There are many facets of the gospel message.
	All of them are important but some are more pertinent depending on the time, place, and audience.
	After establishing a connection with the hearer he describes them, which serves to emplace and prepare them for the message.
	This is how we ought to begin every encounter with God: who is this? what am I doing here? who am I?


1) The issue of life is not _who_ we are, rather, _whose_ we are.
	[1Cor 7:23]
	Paul's servitude to Christ established through years of work.
	If there was any doubt it is dispelled by his acceptance by the elders of Jerusalem-
	these were men he actively, personally persecuted who were swayed by his testimony.
	
	Unlike the others, Paul was not called by Christ during His walkabout.
	Paul was called by a posthumous Jesus.
	
	Paul's distinction is both universal and personal.
	All Christians are set apart for the gospel, given a ministry all their own.
	However, Paul's distinctive ministry was opening the soil of the Roman empire and seeding gospel life there.

2) This is an important consideration for us- the redemption story of God is the most ancient thing in creation.
	That story is declared to us by God through His prophets (those particular servants that He chose for that task.)
  
	Incidentally, it may be obvious to us that we are doing a particular work by divine appointment...but the place in the larger schema is unseeable.
	Edifying those who have turned to dust does them no good, but it does us good as encouragement that we have an important place.

3) The impetus of the God-man who inspires and collaborates was not a new concept to the Greco-Roman person.
	Paul is setting up with this idea the connect with the hearer so that he may then expound and _set apart_ Jesus as unique and preeminent.
  
	The fact that Jesus was a son of David is, of course, important in the grander flow of history.
	At first glance, though, they would see it as a diminishment of Jesus' status; especially that he was "according to the flesh".

4) Appointment is a severely underappreciated concept that Paul skillfully illuminates for us:
	**Jesus was appointed**.
	Was He already king? already God?  Yes, however there must be, according Yahweh's rules of engagement, a declaration of that fact and a public donning of the mantle.
	Hence, the vistitation of 1 Peter 3:19 and resurrection _for over a month_.
	
	This appointment was the crowning and acknowledgment (by the powers that be (including the Father)) of Jesus' power and connection to the Spirit.
	That same Spirit connection is what binds His ministries to him still today.
  
	It is important that this power is holy and based in resurrection.
	Holiness is an indication that this form of influence, daresay governance, is set apart from all others.
	The basis of resurrection is the utmost hope in the possibility of ultimate change for us.
	Loyal followers of Yahweh often experience immediate relief, then a quickening of betterment in body and/or spirit-
	all of which enlightens us and directs us toward the final improvement of placement with God in a new body.
