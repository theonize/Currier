# Romans 1

1) The issue of life is not _who_ we are, rather, _whose_ we are.
	[1Cor 7:23]


18-20) Knowledge of God is available in everyday human experience.
  ...this having been available since the beginning (v.20, Prov 8:22)
  The purpose of this general revelation is to showcase His wreath versus evil.
  God's power and nature are _plainly_ accessible and the understandable- in fact this says seen and understood (past tense, already had.)
  Bottom line: no one can claim ignorance of the law.
  The general revelation yields despair, which drives some away from God.
  However, the _special_ revelation of the gospel/salvation pre-dates the creation and, therefore, the despairing _general_ revelation.
