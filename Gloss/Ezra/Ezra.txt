Two genealogies for Ezra:
  Numbers 16
  Ezra 7


Numbers 16 gives 27
generations whereas Ezra 7 gives 20 generations _for the same
time-span_.  If we take Levi thru Aaron to be around 450yrs, plus
20yr/gen after then the Numbers account would push Ezra into the 2nd
century...conversely the genealogy in Ezra puts us in the 5th century
which lines up much better with the actual end of the exile.
