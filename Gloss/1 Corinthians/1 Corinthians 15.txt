1 Corinthians 15

3-8) the ancestry of the foundation of the Church

5) Interesting that he uses Peter's Aramaic name...Peter has more dealings with with gentiles than most.  The gospel was brought first to the Jews them carried beyond through societal means. 


9) Paul's C.V.
  [Acts 9]
  [Php 3:4+]
  [Acts 22:4]
  [Gal 1:13-14]

10) His grace is not in vain; why? because our output is proportional to the amount of His grace
  [Rom 5:6-8] [2Cor 8:9]
  
  God says, "I Am"
  Man says, "I am what I am"

11) 

12-17) this is a circular argument concerning evidence of ressurection.  The foremost evidence we have is the work of the haggard


37) what you sow = fruit of the Spirit, good works
       = a seed, the kernel

38) God grows the seed into a body
	"as He has chosen"
		already planned [Eph 1:6]
	a different body for each 'kind' of seed ~ a _body_ per kind, like a family/corporate entity

39) four kinds of bodies
        [Deut 4:15-20] an opposition to idols 
         ~ which come in reverse of the created order [Gen 1]

40) celestial bodies akin to [Deut 4]


46) the natural [physical] is preeminent - first a natural seed, then a spiritual one; first a natural body, then a spiritual one.
