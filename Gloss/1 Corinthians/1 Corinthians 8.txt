1 Corinthians 8

1) concerning... this thought is concluded in vv. 7&8 via verse 4
  This "knowledge" is the self-righteous kind [Ps 19] & [Ps 58]
  ...at best it's ammoral
  Knowledge puffs ~ there is an increase
  Love builds ~ substantive
  ...knowledge is the framework, love is the meat/solidity, wisdom is ???

2) we _imagine_ that we know/understand a thing only because we have a finite paradigm
  Just the notion that we have attained something, finally, belies our basic, rebellious misunderstanding of our position - to seek Him [Ps 27:8-9]

3) "known" as in "have accepted the call"
  How do we know if we love Him? if He _knows_ us? ~ [2 Tim 3:12]


6) Paul imports the _sh'ma_ (Deut 6:4) and inserts Jesus into it. 


10) There is a ritual participation that Paul is admonishing them to avoid.
	[1Cor 10:25] ~ Paul allows them to eat the food - not participate in the sacrifice.
