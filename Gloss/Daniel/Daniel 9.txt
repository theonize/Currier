Daniel 9

Outline
- 1-19) Daniel's prayer
- 20-23) Gabriel's visit
- 24-27) 70 weeks

[Jer 29:10-11] is the 70 years, desolations of Jerusalem

[Matt 24-25] [Mark 13] [Luke 21] ~ 




1) Darius 1
	Darius the Mede ben Ahasuerus
	~ _made_ king (by whom?)

2) Darius 1
	I, Daniel (self authenticated, [Matt 24:15])
	perceived (studied) "in the books"
	A) the prophesied timespan
	B) the prophet's given authority
	C) the prophet's source (Yahweh)
	D) must pass...faith in the covenenter
	E) desolations = razing of Jerusalem & Temple
	F) 70 years
	G) a literal interpretation
  [Jeremy 25ish] ~ the passage Daniel read

3) Daniel turned _his_ face to Elohim Addonai
	sought Him via prayer ~ προχιμαι
	pleas for mercy
	...with fasting (blooflow to the brain)
	...sackcloth (lacking vanity)
	...ashes (putting aside the worldly)
4) prayed to Yahweh Elohim, a confession
	Addonai
		great
		awesome Elohim
		covenanter
		steadfast lover
			of those that love Him and keep His commandments
5) iniquity (in escalating order)
	= sin (missing the mark)
	= wrongdoing
	= wickedness (not premeditated)
	= rebellion (premeditated)
6) it is sinful to disregard Biblical prophecy
	prophets spoke from God
	prophets spoke to kings, princes, fathers, and people
		of ?the? land
7) God vs. Man; righteousness vs. open shame
	inhabitants of:
		Judah
		Jerusalem
		Israel
		near
		far
	God drove them away
	~ because of their treachery = rebellion, against God

8) WE own open shame (recognizing Yahweh)
	kings
	princes
	father

9) GOD owns:
	mercy
	forgiveness
	_for_ we are rebels (allowing us recognize Him)

10) we have not obeyed:
		'walking' in His laws
			wading in the water
			...as opposed to [Rev 4:5]
		...these He set before us
			by priests and prophets
				priests stand with their backs to the people and their face to God
				prophets stand with the backs to God and their face to the people

11) all of the Prevailers With God have
		broken the law
		turned aside (from the path)
		refused to obey _His voice_
		...not Word...
	validates the Law because ~ promised curses
		"us"
		sinned against Him [Ps 51:4]
	[2Chr 7:14] ~ behavior determines destiny

12) God confirms His Word
		spoken against "us" (as sinners)
		against "our" rulers
			"ruled" ~ past tense
		bringing (His active intervention)
		...great ער
		...the worst tragedy ever (up to that point)

13) even after this ער "we" didn't seek Him
		neither turned from iniquity
		neither gained His insight
14) הוהי has reserverd the ער for "us"
	because
		1) םהןלא הוהי is righteous in every way
		2) we have not obeyed
15) םהןלא ינדא
		brought His people out of Anguish, mightily
		made a name for Hisself
16) ינדא turn away Your wrath now that Jerusalem is publically shamed

17) _the tempo escalates_

18b) The appropriate approach to God.


"If you torture the data long enough it will confess to anything."

"The stock market had predicted 7 of the last 2 recessions."

23) It takes about ? minutes to read aloud Daniel's prayer.
Therefore, travel time from heaven is about ? minutes.

Daniels eligibility to receive a revelation is his status: he is treasured.


24-27) The Pit of Despair
Weeks of years? most agree...
...and these are all 360day years

Is it the tribulation?
	70th = 7 years
	the "great tribulation" is also 7 years
	what text connects them? none directly

	Two sets set of 70 weeks:
		1st = 70wks as 70yrs (exile length)
		2nd = 70wks as 490yrs (time to crucifixion)
			586-516BC desolations of Jerusalem
			another 70yrs span is the Temple???  >source>
			167-160BC is Maccabean Revolt
			31AD is crucifixion

		[Rev 11:3] [Rev 12:6] doesn't mention 7yrs
		[Dan 9:24-27] not quoted in Revelaton
	
	Sabbatical Cycle
		[Lev 25], [2Chr 36], [Lev 26] - multiple of 7

	Exile
		[Dan 8:12-14]
		assumes v.26a not the same as v.26b
		...annointed one <> prince to come

	the city and the sanctuary were destroyed in 70AD ~ v.26a?
		[Rev 11:2]
		...assumes Revelation authored pre-70AD
		...assumes literal reference
		...assumes 666/616 = Nero

		A 90AD+ autorship date for Revelation meshes w/ Jewish usage of "Babylon" referring to Rome (exclusively)

The purpose of judgment:
- finish rebellion
- put an end to sin
- atone for guilt
- bring everlasting righteousness
- confirm prophetic vision
- anoint the Most Holy Place

25) "the word to restore and build Jerusalm"
	~ Ezra in 458BC
	~ Nehemiah in 445BC
		-> from here, 69 weeks-of-years later is April 6, 32AD (the triumphal entry)

	7wks to the anointed one ~ 7*7yrs ~ 490yrs ~ 32AD beginning of Jesus' ministry


God is not done with Israel or the Jews ~ [Rom 11]
