# Daniel 3

Good did not deliver these believers from the fire;  He delivered them out of the fire.

The image was golden head to toe.
This is directly defiant toward the prophecy of Nebbie as the head of gold.

6) immediately


8+) interesting that the believers are addressed by worldly names


14-15) Note the Nebbie asks a question but doesn't wait for an answer.

15) the worldly "but if you do not"
the immediacy of v.6 is gone,
the peacefulness of the 3 believers had granted them this audience during their rebellion


18) the imagers' reply "but if not".
This is counter to the worldly perspectiveof v.15.
They are answering the old call, "what if?"

What if your God doesn't exist?
Well, even so - this truncated life of contrition is better then your hollow worship and we will not participate.

19) They pushed the friendship to it's limit.
...and Nebbie broke to his own will.


21) They are bound in their proverbial faith [Eph 6:15+]
...not a bad testimony


25) A theophany: son of God ~ regularly applied to Christ.
    However, the divinity of the 4th man is not enough to declare a theophany here: there are many created beings who have a divine nature.
    It is Nebbie's reaction and work of the figure that provide the most proof. 
    It is consistent with His character that He comes alongside us in adversity; [Is 43:2]() [Ps 23:4]()
    Further, the "son of the gods" language could with the salvific event may enhance the christological aspect of the 4th man.
    Theologically, the primary point is the it was God who ultimately brought deliverance and was glorified.
