Daniel (27)
620ish to 539BC

Possibly lived 620-538BC (82yrs).

Authorship dates for range from 6th to 2nd century B.C.
Arguments for a late date of authorship (that are most viable) are that the book fits later apocalyptic genre very well.
The book uses vocabulary and language features dating from the 6th century but also fits with later apocalyptic material (curious if this book was the originating literature for the style.)
Note also that Daniel was part of the Septuagint, which was codified around 300BC ~ so, at the very least it was complete in the form we have now before the messianic prophecies were fulfilled and before many of the grecian prophecies as well.

If we take Jesus' word that A) Daniel was a prophet and B) there are predictive prophecies in his book (e.g. abomination of desolation) then neither view is problematic.
e.g. There are predictions in chapter 11 which are yet future.
Even the latest dates do not circumvent the prophecies.
Also, if the book was written later it does not preclude the fact that the prophet lived and worked earlier.
To a certain extent we see this in every book of the Bible because they were not magically transcribed as is - rather they were carefully, continually compiled and edited by faithful scholars.
Furthermore, Daniel is not the only prophet to receive revelation regarding the kingdoms of the east.
